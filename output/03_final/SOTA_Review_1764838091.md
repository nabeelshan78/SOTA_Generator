# State of the Art Review: Surgical Management of Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction

## 1. INTRODUCTION

Low back pain originating from the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is a prevalent condition, affecting a significant portion of the population and impacting quality of life. When conservative treatments fail, surgical options like arthrodesis become viable (Rahl et al., 2020). Current studies on SIJ fusion complications are often industry-sponsored and may have biases. There is a need for unbiased reports on complication rates and underlying causes, especially regarding user error and implant placement (Rahl et al., 2020). This review analyzes the complications associated with FDA 510(k) cleared sacroiliac joint fusion devices, focusing on minimally invasive techniques and the role of user error. It includes an analysis of the MAUDE database and relevant clinical studies (Rahl et al., 2020). This SOTA is organized to present the background and clinical context of SI joint dysfunction, followed by a detailed analysis of SI joint fusion techniques, comparative analysis of different approaches, evidence synthesis, and a conclusion summarizing key findings and future directions.

## 2. BACKGROUND & CLINICAL CONTEXT

Sacroiliac joint (SIJ) dysfunction is a significant source of low back pain. Diagnosis can be challenging, and treatment ranges from conservative management to surgical fusion. This section provides an overview of the anatomical, pathophysiological, and epidemiological aspects of SIJ dysfunction (Rahl et al., 2020). Sacroiliac joint dysfunction is a significant source of lower back pain (Rahl et al., 2020). The SIJ has intra-articular and extra-articular pain generators (Rahl et al., 2020). Arthrodesis is a viable option when conservative treatment fails (Rahl et al., 2020).

### 2.1 Anatomy & Physiology

The sacroiliac joints (SIJs) are mobile in all 3 anatomic planes (Rahl et al., 2020). The SIJs have been shown to have intra-articular pain generators along with closely associated extra-articular pain generators (Rahl et al., 2020). Understanding the anatomy and biomechanics of the SIJ is crucial for device design and understanding the pathology of SIJ dysfunction.

### 2.2 Pathophysiology

Sacroiliac joint disorders are a well-known medical condition with both surgical and nonsurgical treatment options (Rahl et al., 2020). Symptoms of SIJ dysfunction include low back pain, radicular pain, and unspecified pain (Rahl et al., 2020). When conservative treatment for SIJ pain fails, arthrodesis becomes a viable option to reduce or eliminate pain from this joint (Rahl et al., 2020).

### 2.3 Epidemiology

The prevalence of low back pain originating from the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is thought to range anywhere from 2% to 30% (Rahl et al., 2020). Patients who undergo SI joint fusion using the iFuse implant were predominantly female (58.9%) (Cher et al., 2015). The increasing number of SIJ fusions each year indicates a growing burden on healthcare systems (Rahl et al., 2020).

## 3. CLINICAL PRESENTATION & DIAGNOSIS

Clinical presentation of SI joint dysfunction varies, often mimicking other spinal conditions. Diagnosis involves physical examination, imaging, and diagnostic injections. Treatment ranges from conservative therapies to surgical fusion (Rahl et al., 2020). Core symptoms include low back and radicular pain. Diagnostic criteria involve clinical tests and imaging modalities. The treatment landscape includes non-surgical management and surgical interventions (Rahl et al., 2020).

### 3.1 Symptoms & Functional Impact

The most common symptom reported by patients was radicular pain (38%) (Rahl et al., 2020). This was followed by unspecified pain (25.7%) and SIJ pain (17.2%) (Rahl et al., 2020). Functional limitations include difficulty with activities of daily living, reduced mobility, and impaired work capacity. Chronic pain and functional limitations significantly impact the quality of life of patients with SIJ dysfunction.

### 3.2 Diagnostic Criteria & Imaging

Clinical tests and maneuvers include the Patrick's test, Gaenslen's test, and the Yeoman's test. Imaging modalities such as X-ray, CT, and MRI are used to rule out other causes of pain and assess the SI joint. Differential diagnosis includes lumbar disc herniation, facet joint pain, and hip pathology. Diagnostic accuracy remains a concern due to the lack of standardized criteria.

### 3.3 Current Treatment Landscape

Non-surgical management includes physical therapy, pain medications, injections, and lifestyle modifications. Surgical indications include failure of conservative treatment and confirmed SI joint dysfunction. Decision points involve patient selection and assessment of surgical risks. Surgical approaches include open fusion and minimally invasive fusion techniques (Rahl et al., 2020).

## 4. CORE DEVICE ANALYSIS: SI JOINT FUSION

Minimally invasive SI joint fusion has become increasingly popular. This section reviews different devices used in SI joint fusion, focusing on their intended purpose, design features, mechanism of action, and evidence summary. Minimally invasive SI joint fusion is a common surgical option (Rahl et al., 2020). The iFuse Implant System is a commonly used device (Cher et al., 2015). Device malposition is a common complication (Rahl et al., 2020).

### 4.1 iFuse Implant System Overview

The iFuse Implant System is intended for sacroiliac fusion for conditions including sacroiliac joint dysfunction that is a direct result of sacroiliac joint disruption and degenerative sacroiliitis (Cher et al., 2015). The iFuse Implant System includes a delivery system to place a series of triangular titanium implants coated with a porous titanium plasma spray across the SI joint using a lateral, transarticular approach under fluoroscopic guidance (Cher et al., 2015). The iFuse Implant System has received FDA clearance and is commercially available in the US and other geographies (Cher et al., 2015).

### 4.2 Mechanism of Action

The implant's shape allows for immediate stabilization of the joint and the titanium plasma spray coating allows for biologic fixation in bone (Cher et al., 2015). Biomechanical principles involve load sharing and stabilization of the SI joint. Effective stabilization and fusion can lead to pain reduction and improved function.

### 4.3 Evidence Summary for iFuse

Published literature reports the use of the iFuse Implant System (Cher et al., 2015). Studies have shown positive outcomes in terms of pain reduction and functional improvement (Cher et al., 2015). Key outcomes include fusion rates, pain scores, and functional outcomes. Complications include symptomatic malposition, recurrence of symptoms, and infection (Cher et al., 2015). Evidence strengths include prospective studies and long-term follow-up. Weaknesses include potential for bias and lack of standardized outcome measures.

## 5. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

This section compares different SI joint fusion devices and techniques, focusing on clinical rationale, outcomes, and technical differences. Different devices have varying intended uses and patient profiles. Clinical and safety outcomes vary across different techniques. Technical differences impact biomechanics and procedural steps (Till Berk et al., 2023).

### 5.1 Comparison of Devices

Different devices are intended for specific patient profiles and surgical rationales. For example, some devices are designed for minimally invasive procedures, while others are used in open surgery. Fusion rates, pain reduction, complications, and revision rates vary across different devices and techniques. Some studies have shown higher fusion rates with certain devices, while others have reported lower complication rates. Biomechanical properties, procedural steps, and radiological differences impact the choice of device and surgical technique. For example, some devices require specific instrumentation and surgical approaches (Till Berk et al., 2023; Rahl et al., 2020).

## 6. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS & GAPS

This section synthesizes the key findings from the literature, identifies evidence gaps and limitations, and discusses unmet clinical needs in the surgical management of SI joint dysfunction. Minimally invasive SI joint fusion is a viable option for SIJ dysfunction (Rahl et al., 2020). User error is a significant factor in complications (Rahl et al., 2020). Long-term data and patient selection evidence are lacking (Cher et al., 2015).

### 6.1 Summary of Key Findings

Major clinical insights include the effectiveness of minimally invasive SI joint fusion in reducing pain and improving function (Rahl et al., 2020). Patterns in safety/effectiveness indicate that user error is a significant factor in complications (Rahl et al., 2020). Design-related implications include the need for improved implant placement techniques and device designs that minimize the risk of malposition (Rahl et al., 2020).

### 6.2 Evidence Gaps & Limitations

Methodological weaknesses in the literature include potential for bias, lack of standardized outcome measures, and small sample sizes. Missing populations or endpoints include long-term follow-up data and specific patient subgroups. These gaps limit the ability to draw definitive conclusions about the long-term safety and effectiveness of SI joint fusion (Cher et al., 2015).

### 6.3 Unmet Clinical Needs

Lack of long-term data on the safety and effectiveness of SI joint fusion remains a significant unmet clinical need (Cher et al., 2015). Gaps in patient selection evidence limit the ability to identify the patients who are most likely to benefit from surgery (Cher et al., 2015). There is a need for innovation in device design and surgical techniques to improve outcomes and minimize complications (Cher et al., 2015).

## 7. CONCLUSION

Minimally invasive SI joint fusion is a viable option for SIJ dysfunction, but user error is a significant factor in complications (Rahl et al., 2020). Clinical implications include the need for improved training and patient selection (Cher et al., 2015). Future directions include the development of new devices and surgical techniques, as well as long-term studies to assess the safety and effectiveness of SI joint fusion (Cher et al., 2015). The surgical management of SI joint dysfunction is an evolving field with the potential to improve the lives of patients with chronic low back pain (Rahl et al., 2020; Cher et al., 2015).
