# State of the Art in Sacroiliac Joint Fusion: A Literature Review

## 1. INTRODUCTION
Sacroiliac joint (SIJ) disorders are a well-known medical condition with both surgical and nonsurgical treatment options, impacting patient quality of life (Cher et al., 2015). There is a need for postmarket surveillance to maintain a reasonable assurance of safety for all medical devices used in SIJ fusion, as well as a need to address the lack of formal training (Rahl et al., 2020). This review focuses on surgical revision rates after sacroiliac joint fusion surgery, specifically using the iFuse Implant System, and includes an analysis of complications associated with SIJ fusions using FDA-cleared devices (Cher et al., 2015; Rahl et al., 2020). The review is organized to present background information, clinical presentation, a core device analysis of SI joint fusion, comparative analysis, evidence synthesis, and a conclusion.

## 2. BACKGROUND & CLINICAL CONTEXT

### 2.1 Anatomy & Physiology
The SIJs are mobile in all 3 anatomic planes (Rahl et al., 2020). The SIJs have been shown to have intra-articular pain generators along with closely associated extra-articular pain generators (Rahl et al., 2020). Understanding the anatomy and biomechanics of the SI joint is crucial for proper device placement and surgical outcomes.

### 2.2 Pathophysiology
Low back pain originating from the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is thought to range anywhere from 2% to 30% (Rahl et al., 2020). When conservative treatment for SIJ pain fails, arthrodesis becomes a viable option to reduce or eliminate pain from this joint (Rahl et al., 2020). The choice between surgical and non-surgical treatments depends on the severity of symptoms and the underlying pathology.

### 2.3 Epidemiology
The number of yearly SIJ fusions is on an upward trend (Rahl et al., 2020). The prevalence of SIJ dysfunction varies, affecting a significant portion of the population with low back pain (Rahl et al., 2020). The increasing number of SIJ fusions suggests a growing burden on healthcare systems (Rahl et al., 2020).

## 3. CLINICAL PRESENTATION & DIAGNOSIS

### 3.1 Symptoms & Functional Impact
The most common symptom reported by patients was radicular pain (38%) (Rahl et al., 2020). This was followed by unspecified pain (25.7%) and SIJ pain (17.2%) (Rahl et al., 2020). Functional limitations include difficulties with activities of daily living and reduced mobility. Chronic pain and functional limitations significantly impact the patient's quality of life.

### 3.2 Diagnostic Criteria & Imaging
Clinical tests and maneuvers are used to assess SI joint pain (Till Berk et al., 2023). Imaging modalities such as X-ray are used to assess SI joint malalignment (Till Berk et al., 2023). Differential diagnosis includes other causes of low back pain, such as lumbar disc herniation.

### 3.3 Current Treatment Landscape
Non-surgical management includes physical therapy, pain medications, and injections (Rahl et al., 2020). Surgical indications include failure of conservative treatment and significant functional limitations (Rahl et al., 2020). Surgical approaches include minimally invasive SI joint fusion (Rahl et al., 2020).

## 4. CORE DEVICE ANALYSIS: SI JOINT FUSION

### 4.1 iFuse Implant System Overview
The iFuse Implant System is intended for sacroiliac fusion for conditions including sacroiliac joint dysfunction that is a direct result of sacroiliac joint disruption and degenerative sacroiliitis (Cher et al., 2015). The iFuse Implant System includes a delivery system to place a series of triangular titanium implants coated with a porous titanium plasma spray across the SI joint using a lateral, transarticular approach under fluoroscopic guidance (Cher et al., 2015). The iFuse Implant System has received FDA clearance for commercialization (Cher et al., 2015).

### 4.2 Mechanism of Action
Placement of the implants does not require full decortication of the joint, as is done in other joint fusion procedures (Cher et al., 2015). The implant’s shape allows for immediate stabilization of the joint and the titanium plasma spray coating allows for biologic fixation in bone (Cher et al., 2015). The design aims to provide long-term stability and pain relief (Cher et al., 2015).

### 4.3 Evidence Summary for iFuse
Published literature reports the use of the iFuse Implant System (Cher et al., 2015). Key outcomes include fusion, pain reduction, and improved function (Cher et al., 2015). Complications include symptomatic malposition and symptom recurrence (Cher et al., 2015). Evidence is derived from both prospective trials and retrospective studies (Cher et al., 2015).

## 5. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

### 5.1 Comparison of Devices (Rationale, Outcomes, Technical)
Different devices may be indicated for specific patient profiles or surgical rationales (Rahl et al., 2020). Fusion rates, pain reduction, complications, and revision rates vary among devices (Rahl et al., 2020). Biomechanical principles, procedural steps, and radiological differences distinguish various devices (Till Berk et al., 2023).

## 6. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS & GAPS

### 6.1 Summary of Key Findings
Major clinical insights include the effectiveness of minimally invasive SI joint fusion in reducing pain and improving function (Cher et al., 2015). Patterns in safety/effectiveness show a decrease in revision rates over time, potentially due to improved surgeon experience (Cher et al., 2015). Design-related implications suggest that implant placement and technique are critical for successful outcomes (Cher et al., 2015).

### 6.2 Evidence Gaps & Limitations
Methodological weaknesses in the literature include retrospective study designs and limited long-term follow-up (Cher et al., 2015). Missing populations or endpoints include specific patient subgroups and long-term fusion rates (Cher et al., 2015). These gaps limit the ability to draw definitive conclusions about the long-term effectiveness and safety of SI joint fusion (Cher et al., 2015).

### 6.3 Unmet Clinical Needs
Lack of long-term data on fusion rates and clinical outcomes remains an unmet need (Rahl et al., 2020). Gaps in patient selection evidence make it difficult to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from SI joint fusion (Rahl et al., 2020). There is a rationale for innovation in implant design and surgical techniques to improve outcomes and reduce complications (Rahl et al., 2020).

## 7. CONCLUSION
Minimally invasive SI joint fusion is a promising treatment option for SI joint dysfunction, but further research is needed (Cher et al., 2015). Clinical implications include improved pain relief and function for appropriately selected patients (Cher et al., 2015). Future directions include long-term studies, comparative effectiveness research, and innovation in implant design (Cher et al., 2015; Rahl et al., 2020). SI joint fusion offers a valuable surgical option, but careful patient selection and technique are essential for optimal outcomes (Cher et al., 2015; Rahl et al., 2020).
