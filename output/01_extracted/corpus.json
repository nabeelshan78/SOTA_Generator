Postoperative outcomes (i.e., Cobb, sagittal vertical axis, and pelvic tilt angle) \nand complications (i.e., pseudarthrosis and rod breakage) were assessed. Random effects models (REMs) pooled data for \noutcomes reported in ≥ 2 studies.\nResults  Among 50 studies evaluating ASD surgery using pedicle screw fixation systems, 17 described rod material/diameter. \nPostoperative outcomes did not statistically differ between cobalt–chromium (CoCr) vs. titanium (Ti) rods (n = 2 studies; \nmean [95% confidence interval (CI)] sagittal vertical axis angle: CoCr 37.00° [18.58°–55.42°] and Ti 32.58° [24.62°–40.54°]; \nmean [95% CI] pelvic tilt angle: CoCr 26.20° [22.87°–29.53°] and Ti 20.15° [18.0°–22.31°]). The pooled proportion (95% \nCI) of pseudarthrosis was 15% (7–22%) for CoCr and 12% (− 8–32%) for stainless steel (SS) (n = 2 studies each; ­Chi2 = 0.07, \np = 0.79). The pooled proportion (95% CI) of broken rods was 12% (1–22%) for Ti (n = 3 studies) and 10% (2–19) for CoCr \n(n = 1 study). Among 6.0–6.35 mm rods, the pooled (95% CI) postoperative Cobb angle (n = 2) was 12.01° (9.75°–14.28°), \nsagittal vertical axis angle (n = 4) was 35.32° (30.02°–40.62°), and pelvic tilt angle was 21.11° (18.35°–23.86°).\nConclusions  For ASD patients undergoing posterior fixation and fusion, there are no statistically significant differences in \npostoperative outcomes or complications among rods of varying materials and diameters. Benchmark postsurgical outcomes \nand complication rates by rod material and diameter are provided.\nLevel of Evidence  III\nKeywords  Adult spine deformity · Surgery · Outcomes · Complications · Rods · Meta-analysis\nIntroduction\nAdult spinal deformity (ASD) is a heterogeneous spectrum \nof abnormalities of the lumbar spine or the thoracolum-\nbar spine that occurs in adult patients [1–3]. Specific ASD \ndiagnoses include primary degenerative sagittal imbalance, \niatrogenic spinal deformity, and adult spinal scoliosis [1, \n2]. Symptoms of ASD include back and leg pain, numb-\nness, tingling, and weakness [1]. These symptoms can \nresult in functional limitations including difficulty stand-\ning upright, bending, and lifting, as well as ambulation and \nexercise intolerance [1]. The most common causes of spinal \ndeformity in adults are iatrogenic flatback and degenerative \nscoliosis [1]. The global prevalence of adult spinal deform-\nity is estimated to affect between 32–68% of individuals \naged > 65 years, and the numbers of patients with ASD \nis expected to increase with age progression and a rise in \nlife expectancy [4]. ASD may have a profound impact on a \npatient’s quality of life; however, there is significant vari-\nability in patient presentation [5].\nThe management of ASD usually begins with medical/\ninterventional treatment with the goals of reducing pain and \nimproving function. Operative treatment may be suggested \nfor patients with progressive deformity, neural compromise, \npain, and functional limitations which are not responsive \nto nonoperative conservative treatment [6, 7]. The aim of \noperative management of ASD is to restore spinal balance, \n *\t Dawn Bowden \n\t\ndbowden1@ITS.JNJ.com\n1\t\nDePuy Synthes Spine, Johnson and Johnson Medical \nDevices, 325 Paramount Drive, Raynham, MA 02767, USA\n",

Surgical \ntreatment with pedicle screw fixation systems is a definitive \nmanagement option for patients diagnosed with ASD.\nRecent recognition of the importance of restoring sagittal \nbalance [9], along with advances in surgical techniques and \ninstrumentation have improved postoperative outcomes after \nASD surgery; however, there are still opportunities for fur-\nther improvement [10]. Although surgical management has \nbeen found to be beneficial for carefully selected patients, \nthere is a risk of complications including dural tears, deep \nand superficial wound infections, implant complications, \npseudarthrosis, adjacent segment disease, and acute and \ndelayed neurological deficits [10, 11].\nMultiple factors contribute to the successful correction \nof ASD and to minimizing the complications that may arise \nwith surgical treatment [12, 13]. Spinal fixation rods are \nan important component of pedicle screw fixation systems \nand may play a significant role in the overall surgical out-\ncomes and in the likelihood of complications [12]. Surgeons \nrequire rod options that resist rod fracture and breakage and \nthat deliver the optimal alignment and treatment approach \nto meet the needs of each patient [12–18]. It is important to \ngain a better understanding of the rod-specific factors that \nmay contribute to successful surgical and safety outcomes \nin ASD patients. More specifically, a better understanding \nof the clinical and economic value of various types of rods \navailable for the surgical management of ASD would help \nhealthcare providers and payers prioritize resource alloca-\ntion and develop more effective and targeted interventions \nfor the surgical treatment of ASD. Hence, the objectives of \nthis study were to assess current evidence of the postopera-\ntive outcomes and complications associated with differing \nrod materials and dimensions for the operative treatment of \nASD. An assessment of the current evidence will identify \ngaps that will inform priorities for future research.\nMethods\nStudy design and approach\nThe systematic literature review and meta-analysis com-\npared different rod characteristics for the surgical treatment \nfor ASD. The systematic literature review was conducted \nand reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for \nSystematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guide-\nlines [19]. The systematic review protocol was registered \nin the York PROSPERO database (PROSPERO: A registry \nfor systematic review protocols | Augustus C. Long Health \nSciences Library [columbia.edu]; PROSPERO 2020).\nLiterature search strategy\nThe literature search was conducted on November 20, 2020 \nby electronic searching of MEDLINE, Embase, KOSMET: \nCosmetic Science, APA PsycInfo, and BIOSIS Previews. \nThe search terms and search strategy utilized were: (spine* \nOR vertebra*) AND (fusion AND stabilization) AND (rods) \nAND (adults). The types of studies included were rand-\nomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized clinical \ntrials or studies, cohort studies, case control studies, registry \nstudies, economic studies (budget impact and cost-effective \nanalyses), and case series. Relevant secondary research with \nthe highest levels of evidence, specifically systematic litera-\nture reviews and meta-analyses, was also included. Study \ntypes that were excluded were those that were technical arti-\ncles, animal/cadaver studies, case reports, editorials, com-\nmentaries, and letters. Only English language literature was \nconsidered for review. The search was restricted to articles \npublished on or after January 1, 2010.\nTypes of participants and interventions\nStudies reporting adult patients aged > 18 years at the time \nof surgery, who had been diagnosed with any kind of spinal \ndeformity (including congenital, degenerative, idiopathic, \niatrogenic spinal deformity, flat back syndrome, failed \nback syndrome) were considered for the study. Adult spine \ndeformity patients with other comorbid conditions were also \neligible and were considered for the study. Studies report-\ning patients aged ≤ 18 years were excluded. Similarly, stud-\nies with patients without any spinal deformity were also \nexcluded from the analysis.\nStudies reporting any surgical management for spine \ndeformity using any type of rods were included. While the \nmajority of studies included only or mostly posterior pedicle \nscrew fusion and fixation alone, other approaches included \nanterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF), posterior lumbar \ninterbody fusion (PLIF), transforaminal lumbar interbody \nfusion (TLIF, open or MIS–TLIF) along with the posterior \npedicle screw construct. Deformity correction techniques \nincluded Ponte osteotomy, Smith–Petersen osteotomy \n(SPO), pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO), and vertebral \ncolumn resection (VCR). In addition, studies reporting dif-\nferent types of spine surgeries including primary surgeries, \nsecondary surgeries (i.e., patients who already had previous \nspine surgeries prior to the surgery done during the actual \nstudy), or revision surgeries were also included. Studies \ninvolving surgical management of spine deformity but not \nincorporating rods or pedicle screws were excluded. Studies \n",

The postoperative outcomes that were \nevaluated included postoperative Cobb angle, sagittal verti-\ncal axis angle, and pelvic tilt angle. Postoperative complica-\ntions that were evaluated included pseudarthrosis and rod \nbreakage. Proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) was not evalu-\nated as there were no studies meeting the inclusion criteria \nand evaluating specific rod materials and/or diameters that \nreported PJK.\nStudy selection procedure and data extraction\nTwo reviewers independently applied the inclusion and \nexclusion criteria to screen de-duplicated titles and abstracts \nobtained from the search strategy. Potentially relevant cita-\ntions were checked in a full-text screening. Disagreements \nwere resolved through discussion and reasons for exclusion \nwere recorded. Figure 1 illustrates the study selection pro-\ncess as a PRISMA flow diagram.\nPre-specified data that were extracted from the relevant \nstudies included the journal citation, study objectives, study \ndesign and data source, intervention, comparator, study \npopulation (i.e., baseline demographic and clinical charac-\nteristics), sample size, duration of follow-up, primary and \nsecondary outcome measures, and author’s conclusions.\nQuality assessment of studies\nThe principles and methodology of Evidence-Based Prac-\ntice Guidelines [20] were applied to assess the quality of \nevidence associated with the performance, safety and cost-\neffectiveness outcomes from the clinical studies and reports \nincluded. Studies were appraised for their level of evidence \nbased on the study design and the rigor of methodology \nused, as well as the ability to prevent and/or control for \nbiases to analyze cause and effect. All included studies were \ncritically appraised and ranked using the Evidence level and \nFig. 1   PRISMA flow diagram \nshowing study selection\n",

Qualitative synthesis included sum-\nmarizing individual studies and describing their results with \nrespect to the relevant outcomes. For the quantitative synthe-\nsis, the data were analyzed using RevMan 5.4 and the meta-\nanalysis was performed according to Preferred Reporting \nItems for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) \nguidelines [19]. Pooling and grouping of findings across \nsimilar studies and study designs was done. Non-statistical \nmethodology in synthesizing findings across studies of the \nsame level of evidence was applied. Studies that presented \nand discussed relevant mixed cohort data were analyzed and \nsummarized separately. Meta-analysis was performed for \noutcomes that were reported in at least two included stud-\nies. For continuous outcome measures (length of stay [LOS] \nand operating room [OR] time), the inverse variance random \neffects model (REM) was used to estimate the pooled mean \ndifference (MD). The pooled standardized mean difference \n(SMD) was used for pain scores, since the studies used dif-\nferent pain scales. The mean and standard deviation (SD) \nwere extracted from individual studies or were derived from \nmedians with interquartile ranges or means with p values. \nFor dichotomous outcomes, the Mantel–Haenszel REM was \nused to estimate the pooled risk ratios (RR). For the pooled \nsummary statistics for each outcome in the surgical and non-\nsurgical intervention groups, inverse variance REMs were \nused. All effect sizes were reported with 95% confidence \nintervals (CI). The χ2 test was used to test for statistical het-\nerogeneity (α = 0.05) and heterogeneity was quantitatively \nevaluated using I2 statistics. Subgroup analyses evaluating \nthe impact of (a) duration of study follow-up; (b) rod mate-\nrial; and (c) rod diameter were also conducted. The statisti-\ncal significance was set at p value ≤ 0.05.\nResults\nStudy identification and selection\nThe literature search yielded 1260 citations which were \nscreened for inclusion. Full texts of 537 of the studies \nwere retrieved for further screening, of which 189 were \nexcluded based on the patient population, 59 based on \nthe intervention, 50 based on the study design, 21 due to \nlack of relevant outcomes, 11 due to language, and 6 due \nto duplication of study data. A total of 50 studies evaluat-\ning patients aged > 18 years whose surgical management of \nASD included pedicle screw and rod systems met the study \ninclusion criteria and were included in the systematic litera-\nture review and meta-analysis (Fig. 1).\nDescriptive characterization of studies\nOf the 50 studies evaluating the surgical management of \nASD using posterior rods and pedicle screws, 17 studies \ndescribed the rod material type [23–35]. Fourteen of the 17 \nstudies reported the use of Ti rods either alone [23, 25, 27, \n36, 37] or along with other rod materials.[26, 28–32, 35]. \nEight studies reported the use of CoCr rods, either alone \n[24, 26, 28, 36] or along with other rod material [29, 31, \n32, 34]. Thirteen studies reported the rod diameter used for \nthe surgical management of ASD [23–35]. The rod diam-\neter varied from 5.0 mm [35] to 6.35 mm [28, 32, 33], and \n5.5 mm rods [27, 29]. Table 1 provides a description of the \n50 included studies.\nMeta‑analyses\nImpact of rod material\nClinical and  functional outcomes  Sagittal vertical axis \nOne study utilized CoCr posterior rods for ASD surgery \nand reported the postoperative sagittal vertical axis angle \nof patients (Fig.  2) [24]. The mean postoperative sagittal \nvertical axis angle with CoCr rods was 37.00° (95% CI: \n18.58°–55.42°) [24]. One eligible study with two subgroups \nthat utilized Ti rods reported a mean postoperative sagittal \nvertical axis of 32.58° (95% CI: 24.62°–40.54°) [25].\nPelvic tilt angle One study utilized CoCr posterior rods \nfor ASD surgery and reported the postoperative pelvic \ntilt angle of patients (Fig. 3) [24]. The mean postopera-\ntive pelvic tilt angle with CoCr rods was 26.20° (95% CI \n22.87°–29.53°) [24]. One eligible study with two subgroups \nthat utilized Ti rods reported the postoperative pelvic tilt \nangle [25]. The analysis revealed a mean postoperative pel-\nvic tilt angle of 20.15° (95% CI: 18.0°–22.31°).\nPostoperative complications  Pseudarthrosis Two studies \nused CoCr rods and reported at least one case of pseudar-\nthrosis in adult patients who underwent spine deformity \nsurgery with pedicle screw fixation systems (Fig.  4) [26, \n46]. The overall pooled proportion for pseudarthrosis was \n15% (95% CI 7–22%) in patients receiving CoCr rods. Two \nstudies used stainless steel (SS) rods and reported pseudar-\nthrosis [32, 35]; the overall pooled proportion of pseudar-\nthrosis was found to be 12% (95% CI − 8–32%). Test for \nsubgroup differences showed no significant difference in the \nproportion of pseudarthrosis between the two rod materials \n­(Chi2 = 0.07, p = 0.79).\nRod breakage Three studies that used Ti rods reported \nthe presence of broken rods in adult patients who underwent \n",

The com-\nposition and design of the spinal rod must strike a complex \nbalance: the rod must be flexible enough for the surgeon to \nbend in the desired curve and have a high enough fatigue \nstrength that it does not fracture or break during the thera-\npeutic lifetime of the implant. The ability to resist damage \nbrought about by contouring will depend on the material \nused and the diameter and shape of the rod. There have been \nsignificant changes in the types of rods and the materials \nused for rods over the years. Initially, Harrington rods con-\nsisted of SS. Present-day rod constructs are more likely to \nconsist of either Ti or CoCr. These materials differ in yield \nstrength and stiffness, with Ti having a lower yield strength \nand lower stiffness, and CoCr having higher yield strength \nand higher stiffness.\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis identified 50 \nqualifying studies evaluating the surgical management of \nASD using pedicle screw fixation systems; among which \n17 studies described the rod material and rod diameter used. \nStudy findings showed that there was no evidence that surgi-\ncal outcomes differed by rod material. Two studies reported \nFig. 5   Comparison of rod \nbreakage by rod material\nFig. 6   Evaluation of cobb angle \nby rod diameter\n",

There was an absence \nof evidence evaluating the impact of rod diameter on postop-\nerative outcomes and complications. Among 6.0–6.35 mm \nrods, the pooled postoperative Cobb angle was 12.01° (95% \nCI 9.75°–14.28°), the pooled mean postoperative sagittal \nvertical axis angle was 35.32° (95% CI 30.02°–40.62°), and \nthe pooled mean postoperative pelvic tilt angle was 21.11° \n(95% CI 18.35°–23.86°).\nIn regard to complications, the overall pooled propor-\ntion of pseudarthrosis with CoCr rods (n = 2 studies) was \n15% (95% CI 7.0–22.0%) and with SS rods (n = 2 studies) \nwas 12% [95% CI − 8%–32%) (no significant difference; \n­Chi2 = 0.07, p = 0.79). The pooled proportion of rod break-\nage with Ti rods (n = 3 studies) was 12% (95% CI 1.0% \n–22.0%) and CoCr rods (n = 1 study) was 10% (95% CI \n2–19%). No studies reported postoperative complication \nrates by rod diameter.\nPseudarthrosis is one of the most common complica-\ntions of ASD surgery, and also one of the most common \nand costly indications for revision surgery [73, 74]. Stud-\nies have also increasingly shown a link between pseudar-\nthrosis and rod fracture [10, 34, 75–77]. Pseudarthrosis \nhas been found to occur in over half of patients with rod \nfracture and three-quarters of patients with clinically sig-\nnificant rod fracture [12]. This may be explained by the \neffect of cyclic loading at a non-fused segment, allowing \nmicro-movements to increase construct strain and risk of \ninstrumentation failure [12]. Patients with radiographic \nevidence of pseudarthrosis after one year postoperatively \nmay have increased risk of rod fracture and may require \nmore careful observation [12].\nRod fracture is a common, problematic complication of \nASD surgery, often requiring reoperation [12]. Similar to \nour current analysis, another recent meta-analysis found that \nthe overall incidence of rod fracture was 12% [13]. The other \nmeta-analysis did not evaluate rod characteristics associated \nFig. 7   Evaluation of sagittal \nvertical axis by rod diameter\nFig. 8   Evaluation of pelvic tilt \nangle by rod diameter\n",

Efforts to reduce the \nincidence of rod fracture have been made, including the use \nof CoCr rods and multi-rod constructs; [12–18]; however, \nrod fracture continues to be a significant concern with the \ncurrently available rod treatment options and constructs [13]. \nHence, there is a need for rods with improved fatigue per-\nformance so that breakage and, potentially pseudarthrosis, \nmay be minimized.\nThe systematic review was designed to cover patients \nwith ASD as comprehensively as possible given the pub-\nlished literature. It identified and summarized 50 studies \nevaluating the surgical management of ASD in which pos-\nterior fixation and fusion was part of the treatment plan. \nThe study delineated the paucity of data available, and it is \nunfortunate how few of the studies directly compared rod \nmaterials and/or diameters. PJK was not evaluated in the \ncurrent analyses as there were no studies meeting the inclu-\nsion criteria and evaluating specific rod materials and/or \ndiameters that reported PJK.\nA significant limitation of the meta-analysis component \nof this study is the heterogeneity of the patient populations \nevaluated, the variability in the surgical techniques and tech-\nnologies employed, and the definitions of outcomes used in \nthe analyses [78]. Reasons for such heterogeneity include \nvariability in the definitions of ASD used across the avail-\nable studies, resulting in varying pathologies and patient \npopulations. The inherent complexity of patient needs and \ncomorbidities, along with patient and surgeon treatment \nchoices based on these complexities, further contributed \nto the variability. The requirements for customized surgi-\ncal plans and the availability of published data with results \nfor a specific population with a specific surgical technique \nhinder the accumulation of sufficient numbers of homogene-\nous cases for meta-analyses. Hence, we did not restrict our \nreview to particular surgical treatments such as pedicle sub-\ntraction osteotomies (PSOs) or vertebrectomies or to types \nof technologies such as the use of interbody devices or spe-\ncific grafting material. High volume, multi-center studies \nwith shared definitions and consistent methods of document-\ning variability will be needed to address the knowledge gaps.\nMeta-analysis may offer a way to highlight findings \nwithin such heterogeneity, including exposing areas for \nfuture research. It also provides a tool for helping to under-\nstand the extent of variability [79–81]. In the field of spinal \nprocedures, a growing opinion suggests that inclusion of \nobservational studies in meta-analyses might lead to more \nrobust conclusions without compromising the quality of the \nresults [82, 83]. The current study was conducted in line \nwith recommendations available in the literature for the use \nof real-world evidence in meta-analyses [84]. Statistical het-\nerogeneity was evaluated using Cochran’s Q test (χ2 test) \nand the ­I2 statistic. Since Q was significant and I2 was > 50%, \nit was appropriate to use the random-effects model (REM) to \ncalculate pooled summary estimates. The range of I2 values \nobserved in the current study (0% to 98%) is not inconsist-\nent with the range of those observed in other meta-analyses \nof observational data. The heterogeneity present suggests \nthat the meta-analysis covered a broad spectrum of patients \nwith ASD, and the findings establish a foundation for future \nprospective and retrospective research.\nConclusions\nFor patients with ASD, there is a paucity of data evaluating \nthe impact of rod material and rod diameter on ASD postop-\nerative outcomes and complications. However, the current \nstudy provides benchmark measures of outcomes and com-\nplications for rods of varying material and diameter. Studies \nthat presented postoperative outcomes and complications of \nASD surgery by rod material and/or diameter had sizable \ncomplication rates. Technologies with improved fatigue \nperformance (i.e., resisting rod fracture or breakage) could \nimprove clinical and functional outcomes and complications.\nAuthor contributions  DB, Study conception and design, data collection \nand analysis, and manuscript preparation, revision, and final approval. \nAM, Study conception and design, data collection and analysis, and \nmanuscript revision and final approval.

However, compared with conventional reinforcement methods,\nthe advantages of bone cement-reinforced FPSs remain undetermined. This article compares the effects\nof fenestrated and conventional pedicle screws (CPSs) combined with bone cement in the treatment of\nosteoporosis.\nMethods: A clinical control study of FPSs and CPSs combined with bone cement reinforcement in\nosteoporotic vertebral internal ﬁxation was performed using the database PubMed, Embase, Cochrane\nLibrary, CNKI, the Wanfang, and the China Biomedical Literature Service System. Two evaluators screened\nthe relevant literature in strict accordance with the inclusion criteria (diagnosis of participants, type of\nclinical study, treatment with FPS and CPS, and outcome indicators) and exclusion criteria (duplicate\nliterature and missing or incorrect data) and independently conducted data extraction and quality\nevaluation. Clinical control studies of direct comparison between FPS and CPS combined with bone\ncement reinforcement in patients who were deﬁnitively diagnosed with thoracolumbar fractures or\nspinal degenerative diseases were included. Quality evaluation was conducted using the Cochrane risk\nbias evaluation tool for randomized controlled studies and using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for retro-\nspective case-control studies. RevMan software (version 5.3) was used for the meta-analysis to compare\nthe clinical efﬁcacy, radiological results, and related complications of the 2 methods.\nResults: A total of 13 articles were included, including 7 randomized controlled studies and 6 retro-\nspective case-control studies. There were 909 patients in these studies, 451 in the FPS and polymethyl\nmethacrylate (FPS & PMMA) group and 458 in the CPS and polymethyl methacrylate (CPS & PMMA)\ngroup. The results of the meta-analysis showed that there was no signiﬁcant difference between the 2\ngroups in operation time, hospital stay, visual analogue score, Japanese orthopaedic association score,\nOswestry disability index score, Cobb angle, vertebral body deformation index and fusion rate (p > 0.05).\nThe mean difference of intraoperative bleeding volume was \u000110.45, (95% conﬁdence intervals (CI)\n(\u000116.92, \u00013.98), p ¼ 0.002), the mean difference of loss height of the anterior edge of the vertebral body\nafter surgery was \u00010.69 (95% CI (\u00010.93, \u00010.44), p < 0.001), and the relative risk (RR) of overall\ncomplication rate was 0.43 (95% CI (0.27, 0.68), p < 0.001), including the RR of bone cement leakage rate\nwas 0.57 (95% CI (0.39, 0.85), p ¼ 0.005). The screw loosening rate (RR ¼ 0.26, 95% CI (0.13, 0.54),\np < 0.001) of the FPS group was signiﬁcantly lower than that of the CPS group.\nConclusion: The existing clinical evidence shows that compared with the CPS combined with bone\ncement, the use of FPS repair in the internal ﬁxation of an osteoporotic vertebral body can reduce the\namount of intraoperative bleeding, be more conducive to maintaining the height of the vertebral body,\n* Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: 1273556978@qq.com (B.-H.

Introduction\nOsteoporosis, a prevalent condition among the elderly, is an\nescalating global health concern, impacting around 200 million\nindividuals globally.1,2 Pedicle screw internal ﬁxation is extensively\nemployed in managing spinal degenerative ailments and thor-\nacolumbar fractures. For secure stable and efﬁcacious use of pedicle\nscrew internal ﬁxation in preventing screw loosening, fracture, or\ninadequate bone graft, spinal decompression and internal ﬁxation\nfusion of patients with osteoporosis have become a pivotal point of\nspinal surgery.\nCurrently, the methods of improving the screw stability in pa-\ntients with osteoporosis mainly include: (1) modiﬁcation of the\nscrews, such as thicker and longer screws, expandable screws, and\ncoated screws;3e5 (2) advancement in nailing technology, such as\ncortical bone track nailing technology;6 and (3) utilization of bone\ncement for reinforcing pedicle screws.7 Studies have indicated that\nosteoporosis substantially elevates the risk of internal ﬁxation\nfailure, and when necessary, the application of bone cement rein-\nforcement technology proves to be a viable method. According to\ndifferent screw designs, 2 primary methods exist for augmenting\nbone cement. One of the methods is the employment of the stan-\ndard vertebroplasty to inject bone cement into the screw path and\nsubsequently implant of a conventional pedicle screw (CPS) before\nthe solidiﬁcation of the bone cement. Another one is initially to\ninsert the fenestrated pedicle screw (FPS) and then inject bone\ncement from the side-hole of the screw through the screw tail for\nreinforcement.8,9 Although both methods achieve the objective of\nenhancing screw stability, complications associated with bone\ncement should be considered carefully, notably the leakage of bone\ncement into the spinal canal leading to compression of the spinal\ncord and nerve or into the bloodstream inducing cardiac arrest and\npulmonary embolism.10,11 The ﬁrst method is used frequently by\nspine surgeons, and its efﬁcacy is widely recognized.\nThe FPS was invented by Peter J. Ludwig, a famous German\nspinal surgeon, in the 1970s. Through continuous improvement and\nachievement of reduced vibration noise, enhanced reliability,\nsimpliﬁed and efﬁcient installation, and accelerated operation\nprogress,8 the hollow pedicle screw currently used has better\nbiomechanical fatigue resistance than the CPS. A large number of\nstudies have demonstrated that the effect of FPS combined with\nbone cement reinforcement is comparable to that of traditional\nmethods, and the incidence of complications is low. To analyze the\ndifferences in clinical efﬁcacy, radiological results, and complica-\ntions between the 2 methods in a more detailed and comprehen-\nsive way, a clinical control study of FPS and CPS combined with\nbone cement polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) reinforcement is\nconducted. Meanwhile, after strict screening, a meta-analysis is\nperformed to provide a reference basis for the clinical placement\nstrategy of osteoporotic vertebral bodies.\n2. Methods\n2.1.

After carefully reading the full\ntext of the remaining 23 papers, 13 were excluded according to the\nexclusion criteria.12e24\n2.4. Document quality evaluation adopt\nThe Cochrane risk bias evaluation tool provided in the Cochrane\nevaluation manual 5.1.0 (https://training.cochrane.org/handbooks)\nwas used. Randomized controlled studies were evaluated for bias\nrisk from 7 items: selection bias (random sequence generation and\ndistribution concealment), implementation bias, measurement\nbias, follow-up bias, reporting bias, and other bias. Each item was\ndivided into 3 levels: low-risk,\nhigh-risk, and unclear. The\nNewcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to evaluate the quality of\nthe included cohort studies from 3 aspects: selection, compara-\nbility, and results. The 7 e 9 points indicated high quality, 4 e 6\npoints indicated medium quality, and < 3 points indicated low\nquality. The evaluation was conducted independently by 2 evalu-\nators, and if there is disagreement, it is assessed by a professional\nstatistician.\n2.5. Outcome indicators\nSurgical-related complications, operation time, intraoperative\nblood loss, inpatient time, visual analog score, JOA score, ODI score,\nCobb angle of the operation segment, loss height of the anterior\nedge of the vertebral body, vertebral body deformation index, and\nfusion rate were recorded.\n2.6. Statistical analysis\nThe\nCochrane\nCollaboration\nnetwork\n(https://www.\ncochranelibrary.com) RevMan5.3 statistical software was used for\nthe data analysis. Counting data were represented by the relative risk\n(RR) and measurement data were represented by the weighted mean\ndifference (MD). Both values provided a 95% conﬁdence interval (CI)\nand the test level was a ¼ 0.05. The I2 test was used to assess the\nheterogeneity of each study, and I2 < 50% was used as the test\nstandard. When there was homogeneity between the studies\n(p \u0003 0.05, I2 < 50%), the ﬁxed-effect model was used for meta-\nanalysis. If there was heterogeneity among the studies (p < 0.05,\nI2 \u0003 50%), after excluding signiﬁcant clinical heterogeneity, the\nrandom-effects model was used for meta-analysis.\n3. Results\n3.1. Literature search results\nFinally, 13 papers12e24 were included as shown in Table 1. A total\nof 909 patients were included, of which 451 were treated with\ninternal ﬁxation of FPS strengthened with bone cement, and 458\nwith CPS combined with bone cement. Fig. 1 illustrates the\ndocument-retrieval process.\n3.2. Document quality evaluation results\nSeven randomized controlled studies18e24 used the Cochrane\nrisk bias assessment tool for quality evaluation, 2 of which had high\nrisk bias22,24 and 5 had low risk bias.18e21,23 None of the studies\nmentioned blinding of the participants and researchers. The\nblinding of outcome evaluators had little impact on outcome in-\ndicators, as shown in Fig. 2.

Research signiﬁcance\nPedicle screw internal ﬁxation is a commonly employed tech-\nnique for stabilizing the thoracolumbar spine, which is used for\ncorrecting deformities, facilitating bone fusion, and ﬁxing fractured\nvertebral bodies. However, recent studies have indicated that\nosteoporosis represents a signiﬁcant risk factor for screw loosening\nin individuals undergoing posterior spinal fusion and internal ﬁx-\nation procedures.25,26 When the bone mineral density of the\nvertebral body decreases by 16.5%, 33.6%, and 51.2%, the maximum\naxial extraction force decreases by 27.2%, 45.7%, and 68.5%,\nrespectively.27 Studies have demonstrated that the average pullout\nstrength of a screw reinforced with bone cement is approximately\n400 N higher than an unreinforced screw. This reinforcement\ntechnique can signiﬁcantly enhance the pullout strength of pedicle\nscrews in osteoporotic vertebral bodies.28 However, the combina-\ntion of CPS and bone cement reinforcement presents certain\ndrawbacks, such as a relatively complex procedure and a high\nincidence of bone cement leakage. A new type of hollow pedicle\nscrew with side holes for bone cement infusion has recently\nemerged and gained attention of researchers both domestically and\ninternationally due to its advantages of simpliﬁed operation and\nimproved stability. However, it remains uncertain whether bone\ncement-reinforced pedicle screws offer additional beneﬁts in\nreducing\npostoperative\ncomplications,\nsuch\nas\nbone\ncement\nleakage and screw loosening.29,30 This article gathers comparative\nFig. 4.

      "10": "studies on FPS and conventional reinforcement methods from both\ndomestic and international sources, aiming to comprehensively\nevaluate the disparities in clinical effectiveness and complications\nand furnish evidence-based medical data to inform the internal\nﬁxation strategy for osteoporosis.\n4.2. Analysis of studies results\nThe meta-analysis results demonstrate that there is no notable\ndisparity in the operation time and inpatient duration between the\nFPS & PMMA and CPS & PMMA groups. However, in terms of\nintraoperative bleeding, the FPS & PMMA group exhibits lower\nbleeding compared to the CPS & PMMA group. This difference may\nbe due to the direct injection of bone cement after the placement of\npedicle screws in the FPS & PMMA group, thus eliminating the need\nto inject bone cement prior to screw placement after preparing the\nscrew pathway. Therefore, this approach can reduce the amount of\nblood leakage in the screw pathway. Relief of postoperative pain,\nimprovement of function and fusion rate are crucial indicators of\nclinical effectiveness. Several studies have indicated that applying\nPMMA to reinforce FPS produces clinical effects like those of con-\nventional methods, and the application of PMMA also has the\nadded beneﬁt of improving the ODI score of patients.21,31 Wang\net al.20 further highlight that PMMA-enhanced FPS can effectively\nenhance fusion speed, and their study reveals no signiﬁcant dif-\nference in the visual analog score, JOA score, and ODI score between\nthe 2 groups post-surgery. Furthermore, the fusion rate shows no\nremarkable variance between the 2 groups, suggesting that both\ngroups can achieve comparable and optimal clinical outcomes.\nThe Cobb angle of the ﬁxed segment, vertebral body deforma-\ntion index, and anterior edge height of the vertebral body are the\ncrucial indicators of spinal stability. Postoperative follow-up ob-\nservations can directly and effectively reﬂect the stability of inter-\nnal ﬁxation. From a radiological perspective, the meta-analysis\nresults reveal no signiﬁcant difference in the Cobb angle between\nthe 2 groups post-surgery, indirectly indicating similar effects on\nimproving the Cobb angle of the lesion segment. Similarly, there is\nno signiﬁcant difference in the vertebral body deformation index.\nHowever, the loss height of the anterior edge of the vertebral body\nin the FPS & PMMA group is lower than that in the CPS & PMMA\ngroup, suggesting that FPS & PMMA has an advantage in main-\ntaining vertebral body height and preventing further loss of height.\nMost hollow lateral arch root screws have lateral holes located\nmainly anterior to the screw, and some screws also have holes at\nthe tip. This arrangement allows the bone cement to be injected\ninto the vertebral body through evenly distributed holes, effectively\npreventing\nvertebral\ncollapse\nand\nreducing\nthe\nrisk\nof\nre-\nfracture.32e34\nHowever, there is a high degree of heterogeneity among the\nvarious observation indicators of clinical efﬁcacy and radiological\nresults in different studies, which may result in some bias in the\nﬁndings. The reasons for heterogeneity are summarized as follows:\n(1) differences in the measurement standards of the same index\nacross studies; 2) inconsistent baseline data of patients; and 3)\ndifferences in the experience and skill of the surgeons involved. To\naddress this issue, sensitivity analysis is conducted to exclude\nstudies that could potentially contribute to heterogeneity. After re-\nanalysis of the combined data, no signiﬁcant changes in effect sizes\nare observed, indicating that the conclusion is relatively reliable.\nDue to the unique properties of bone cement, this article focuses\non the safety and potential complications of surgery. The leakage of\nbone cement into the spinal canal can lead to compression of the\nspinal cord and nerves, while into the bloodstream it can result in\nserious complications such as cardiac arrest and pulmonary\nembolism, necessitating close attention.35,36 Results of the meta-\nanalysis indicate that the use of FPS signiﬁcantly reduces the\noverall incidence of complications, with the respective complica-\ntion rates for the 2 groups being 10.90% and 25.84%, respectively.\nThe most frequent complications include bone cement leakage and\nscrew loosening. Speciﬁcally, the incidence of these complications\nin the FPS & PMMA group are 7.02% and 1.69%, compared to 12.44%\nand 7.18% in the CPS and PMMA groups, respectively. Notably,1 case\nin the FPS & PMMA group experiences neurological symptoms due\nto bone cement leakage,12 while another case in the CPS & PMMA\ngroup\nmanifests\nneurological\nsymptoms\narising\nfrom\ncage\ndisplacement due to screw loosening.22 However, no serious\ncomplications such as cardiac arrest or pulmonary embolism are\nreported.\nDespite the emergence of numerous bone cement substitutes in\nclinical practice, PMMA is still considered the primary material for\nbone cement due to its wide range of application and excellent\noverall performance. PMMA is characterized by its biological\ninertness, low viscosity, ease of injection, rapid solidiﬁcation, and\nhigh curing strength. However, its exothermic polymerization re-\naction presents a potential risk of causing damage to surrounding\ntissues or nerves. Speciﬁcally, thermal damage is primarily associ-\nated with the leakage of bone cement. In the absence of bone\ncement leakage, the exothermic polymerization reaction does not\ndirectly lead to thermal damage to the surrounding tissues.37 Guo\net al.38 demonstrated that in patients with bone cement leakage\ndue to PMMA reinforcement screws, there is a high rate of leakage\nfrom the segmental and basal vertebral veins, which usually pre-\nsents as asymptomatic leakage. The study reports only 1 case with\nnerve injury resulting from bone cement leakage into the spinal\ncanal. No other literature has reported symptomatic bone cement\nleakage, consistent with Guo's ﬁndings. The conventional method\nof nail path enhancement involves injecting bone cement through\nthe nail path. However, the distribution of bone cement cannot be\ncontrolled during the injection process, and the screw is inserted\nbefore the solidiﬁcation of the cement. Consequently, the bone\ncement may ﬂow back and leak through the nail path, leading to\ncomplications.39\nSome researchers have suggested that the use of FPS can be\neffective in reducing the incidence of bone cement leakage by\nutilizing the distance between the lateral hole and the posterior\nvertebral canal. The FPS technique enables the formation of mul-\ntiple interfaces, including \"screw & bone,” \"screw & bone cement,”\nand \"bone cement & bone” through the lateral hole, which in turn\nenhances the resistance to screw pullout. In contrast, the non-\nuniform dispersion of bone cement injected using conventional\nmethods can result in poor biomechanical stability, which may\ncontribute to screw loosening, uneven force distribution, and sub-\nsequent\nneurological\nsymptoms.\nOsteoporotic\nvertebrae\nmay\nexhibit a reduction in trabecular number up to 50% compared to\nhealthy vertebrae, so the ﬁxation strength provided by natural bone\nalone might not be sufﬁcient. However, the use of PMMA-enhanced\nscrews can signiﬁcantly improve the stability.22 The key advantage\nof FPS over conventional screws is the enhanced convenience and\nsafety of the bone-cement perfusion process. FPS can be evenly\ndispersed within the vertebral body through the lateral foramina.\nTherefore, during cement injection, the bone cement can be evenly\ndistributed around the FPS, generating multiple adhesive in-\nterfaces. Biomechanical studies are conducted to evaluate the\nextraction force of screws reinforced with PMMA using Instron\ntesting equipment post-treatment. The results reveal that the\nextraction force of screws reinforced with body shaping surgery\n(average 918.5 N, p ¼ 0.001) is signiﬁcantly greater than that of the\ncontrol group without PMMA reinforcement (average 51 N).

However, there is no\nstatistically signiﬁcant difference between the 2 groups.\n4.3. Limitations of the study\nThere are some limitations in the study. A predominant inclu-\nsion of Chinese literature may potentially introduce language bias.\nDespite the high quality of the included studies, the lack of refer-\nence to blinding in the included randomized controlled trials and\nthe wide variation in follow-up times may have resulted in de-\nﬁciencies in study design and bias control. Discrepancies in the\noperating surgeon's experience, as well as variations in patient age,\nsex, pedicle screw type and quantity, bone cement quantity, sur-\ngical segment, and assessment criteria for certain indicators across\nthe studies could have impacted on the results. Discrepancies in\nresearchers' retrieval capabilities and the utilized databases,\ncoupled with potential non-publication with negative results, may\nlead to publication bias. These factors could have inﬂuenced the\nrobustness of the conclusions.\nIn conclusion, both bone cement reinforced FPS and CPS\nmethods demonstrate comparable and favorable clinical outcomes.\nThe structural design advantages of FPS enhance the convenience\nand safety of the procedure. In comparison to conventional rein-\nforcement methods, FPS has been shown to diminish intraoperative\nbleeding, aid in preserving vertebral body height, and signiﬁcantly\ndecrease the occurrence of complications such as bone cement\nleakage and screw loosening. Nonetheless, owing to the constraints\nof this study, the ﬁndings necessitate cautious interpretation. It is\nadvisable to conduct clinical studies with larger sample sizes, more\nrational designs, and higher quality to validate this conclusion.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nLi Cao: Writing - original draft, Formal analysis.

Vertebral augmentation (VA)—vertebroplasty and/or kyphoplasty—is the main treatment modal-\nity, but additional short-segment fixation (SSF) has been recommended concomitant to VA. The aim is to compare clinical \nand radiological outcomes of VA + SSF versus VA alone. Systematic review, including comparative articles in Kümmell’s \ndisease, was performed. This study assessed the following outcome measurements: visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry \nDisability Index (ODI), anterior vertebral height (AVH), local kyphotic angle (LKA), operative time, blood loss, length of \nstay, and cement leakage. Six retrospective studies were included, with 126 patients in the VA + SSF group and 152 in VA \nalone. Pooled analysis showed the following: VAS, non-significant difference favoring VA + SSF: MD –0.61, 95% CI (–1.44, \n0.23), I2 91%, p = 0.15; ODI, non-significant difference favoring VA + SSF: MD –9.85, 95% CI (–19.63, –0.07), I2 96%, \np = 0.05; AVH, VA + SSF had a non-significant difference over VA alone: MD –3.21 mm, 95% CI (–7.55, 1.14), I2 92%, \np = 0.15; LKA, non-significant difference favoring VA + SSF: MD –0.85°, 95% CI (–5.10, 3.40), I2 95%, p = 0.70. There \nwere higher operative time, blood loss, and hospital length of stay for VA + SSF (p < 0.05), but with lower cement leakage \n(p < 0.05). VA + SFF and VA alone are effective treatment modalities in Kümmell’s disease. VA + SSF may provide superior \nlong-term results in clinical and radiological outcomes but required a longer length of stay.\nKeywords  Osteoporosis · Vertebral fracture · Vertebroplasty · Pedicle screws · Kümmell’s disease\nIntroduction\nKümmell’s disease is defined as the presence of avascular \nosteonecrosis of the vertebral body, creating a pseudoarthro-\nsis. It is well recognized as a complication of osteoporotic \nvertebral compression fracture (OVCF) with consequent \ndevelopment of spinal instability, pain, kyphosis, disabil-\nity, and eventually neurological compromise [14], generally \nafter a minor spinal trauma [12].\nTreatment strategies for Kümmell’s disease may be non-\noperative, with pain medication and bracing [7]. However, it \nmay need to be surgically managed when pain is refractory, \nthere is deformity progress, or neurological deficit appears. \nVertebral augmentation (VA), with percutaneous kyphop-\nlasty (PKP) or percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP), has suc-\ncessfully restored vertebral height and decreased pain in \nsome clinical series [7, 10].

For continuous variables, \nthe mean difference with a 95% CI was calculated, and for \ndichotomous outcomes, the odds ratio with a 95% CI by \nthe Mantel–Haenszel method. For non-randomized studies, \nthe outcomes VAS, ODI, AVH, and LKA were compared \nbetween experimental and control groups, using the change-\nfrom-baseline method, calculating mean difference change \nfrom preoperative to the final follow-up. Statistical hetero-\ngeneity among studies was evaluated using I2 test; the fixed-\neffect model was used if I2 < 50%, while the random-effect \nmodel was employed when I2 > 50%.

      "8": "1 3\nWhen considering radiological parameters, VA + SSF \nhas shown better LKA correction and AVH restoration as \ncompared to VA alone [1, 5, 9, 23]. The use of short-seg-\nment pedicle screws may allow further correction with rod \nmaneuvers, which may explain the improvement in LKA. \nThe rational to add SSF in VA is to avoid further collapse, \ndelayed cement displacement, and refracture, which has \nbeen reported in some studies when patients with Kümmell’s \ndisease were treated with VA alone [11, 20, 25]. The unique \npattern of cement filling in an empty space instead of cement \ndiffusion with trabecular bone observed in acute osteoporo-\ntic fractures has been mentioned as a possible cause of poor \nstability in Kümmell’s disease patients [22].\nPVP and PKP alone in the surgical treatment of OVCF \nwith intravertebral cleft have been compared, demonstrat-\ning similar results in VAS, ODI, LKA, and AVH. However, \nkyphoplasty was associated with lower complication rates, \nespecially cement leakage—potentially explained by the \nfact that in kyphoplasty, the cement is injected with lower \npression [24]. This is of paramount importance when VA \nalone has been chosen. Of note, both minimally invasive \ntechniques can be associated with delayed onset cement \ndislodgement in the context of vacuum cleft, leading to a \ncircumferential instrumentation as a revision surgery [3]. \nSSF treatment possibly reduces the rate of failure and the \noccurrence of this undesired complication.\nPotential advantages of VA + SSF are that it can effec-\ntively shorten the entire construct [18], and biomechanically, \nit possibly reduces the load of dorsal implants and possibly \nthe risk of implant failure [4]. VA alone, using PKP, can \ndevelop a new collapse of the cemented vertebrae during \nmid-term follow-up, being associated with the presence of \nan intravertebral cleft, a lack of contact between injected \ncement and endplates, and increased postoperative vertebral \nheight [21]. However, a recent clinical analysis comparing \nPKP versus PVP + SSF found that these two surgical meth-\nods had a similar effect on improving the studied outcomes \n(VAS, ODI, LKA), with similar cement leakage [13].\nFig. 5   Forest plot of the included studies comparing VA + SSF versus VA alone in cement leakage\nTable 6   Postoperative complications of the six studies included by treatment groups\nComplications as reported in the original six studies included\n** One of them underwent prophylactic decompression without neurological compromise\nFirst author (year) VA + SSF\nVA\nN\nFrequency, N (%) Postoperative complications (N)\nN\nFrequency, N (%) Postoperative complications (N)\nHsieh [5] (2013)\n22\n2 (9)\nRight leg weakness (1); New vertebral \nfracture (1)\n24\n1 (4.2)\nNew vertebral fracture (1)\nChen [1] (2015)\n23\n6 (26)\nCement leakage (5)**; Hardware \nremoval (1)\n31\n11 (35.4)\nCement leakage (11)\nKim [9] (2016)\n18\n6 (33.3)\nScrew breakage (1); Screw pullout (1); \nAtelectasis (2); New vertebral fracture \n(1); Superficial wound infection (1)\n31\n2 (6.4)\nSevere vertebral collapse (2)\nLi [10] (2017)\n21\n3 (14.3)\nCement leakage (1); Superficial wound \ninfection (2)\n25\n2 (8)\nCement leakage (2)\nHuang [6] (2018)\n28\n6 (21.4)\nCement leakage (3); Urinary infection \n(1); Pneumonia (1); Delayed wound \nhealing (1)\n32\n3 (9.3)\nCement leakage (3)\nWang [23] (2020)\n14\n1 (7.4)\nWound healing (1)\n9\n4 (44.4)\nCement leakage (4)\nTotal\n126 24 (19.0%)\n152 23 (15.1%)\n1016\nNeurosurgical Review (2022) 45:1009–1018\n",
      "9": "1 3\nThe surgical treatment at the time of diagnosis requires \nto be more aggressively performed than VA alone, due to \nthe high rate of related complications during follow-up [11, \n25]. Comparing the same techniques in an acute scenario \nof OVCF, PVP alone is significantly associated to more \nfracture of the treated vertebrae and adjacent vertebras \nwhen compared to hybrid stabilization [2]. Even though the \nVA + SSF group had significant differences in terms of blood \nloss, operative time, and hospital length of stay, it was not \nassociated with increased rates of cement leakage as was the \ncase with the VA group.\nThis systematic review has some limitations that need to \nbe addressed; on the one hand, our study included only six \nobservational retrospective articles with a relatively small \nnumber of cases, with each of them having moderate qual-\nity of evidence. This could affect the strength of our results \nand, therefore, the quality of the systematic review. On the \nother hand, Kümmell’s disease is a relatively infrequent \npathology, making it difficult to carry out larger prospective \nstudies. Another limitation is that two studies did not report \npreoperative BMD [5, 6] that could influence the results \ndue to the negative effect of osteoporosis in surgical treat-\nment of spinal conditions, as well as only two studies [1, \n23] used a clinical stage classification of the disease prob-\nably impacting the choice of treatment modality. Another \nlimitation is related to the short time of follow-up for this \npathology, requiring longer time of observation for detecting \na wider spectrum of complications, and for assessing more \naccurately the superiority of one technique over the other. \nFinally, there are different procedures considered in vertebral \naugmentation, making the analysis more clinically heteroge-\nneous as well as some outcomes in the pooled analysis with \nconsiderable statistical heterogeneity.\nNevertheless, this systematic review has also some \nstrengths: first, the assessment of outcomes in a long fol-\nlow-up rather than a comparison between preoperative and \npostoperative outcomes; secondly, subsequent to the study \ndesign of the studies included—non-randomized—the dif-\nferent preoperative clinical and radiological outcomes were \nanalyzed by arm, using the change-from-baseline, com-\nparing the amount of improvement between experimental \nand control groups. Finally, it provides useful insights for \na rare pathology that would be advisable when surgeons \nchoose VA + SSF versus VA alone, using the best evidence \navailable.\nConclusions\nVA in combination with SSF or alone can effectively treat \nKümmell’s disease of the thoracolumbar spine in neurologi-\ncal intact patients, improving outcomes of VAS, ODI, AVH, \nand LKA significantly. However, VA + SSF is associated \nwith a trend to have better clinical and radiological outcomes \nas well as lower rates of cement leakage, but with higher \noperative time, blood loss, and hospital length of stay than \nVA alone. Further studies are needed to increase the quantity \nand quality of evidence regarding this controversial topic \nand validate the best surgical treatment for this challenging \ndisease.\nAcknowledgements  This study was organized by the AO Spine Latin \nAmerica.
