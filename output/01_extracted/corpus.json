Dall, MD\nStudy Design: This was a level III—retrospective cohort study.\nObjective: The objective of this study was to present an unbiased\nreport of the current rate of severe complications for Federal Drug\nAdministration (FDA) 510(k) cleared sacroiliac joint (SIJ) fusions\nand investigate the underlying cause of these complications.\nSummary of Background Data: The number of yearly SIJ fusions\nis on an upward trend. Currently, the most utilized implants to\nfuse the SIJ have been FDA 510(k) cleared devices. Studies re-\nporting on complications following SIJ fusions are mostly\nindustry-sponsored.\nMaterials and Methods: The Manufacturer and User Facility\nDevice Experience (MAUDE) database was searched for all re-\nported FDA 510(k) cleared SIJ fusion device complications.\nSeveral data points were obtained from each report and re-\ncorded. The Hospital Inpatient National Statistics and the\nCenter for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) was also\nsearched for the number of SIJ fusions performed each year.\nResults: A search of the MAUDE database returned 1115 reports,\nwith the ﬁrst report on June 30, 2011, and the last report on July 28,\n2020. Patient injury was the most common type of event reported at\n97.5% (1080/1107). Death was reported in 3 patients (0.3%). Mal-\nposition was the most common device problem at 49.5% (548/\n1107). The root cause of these events was primarily user error at\n58.2% (644/1107). Revision surgery or reoperation occurred in\n92.8% (1028/1107) of reports. Data for SIJ fusions through CMS\nshowed an overall trend of increasing yearly SIJ fusions.\nConclusions:\nThe\nmajority\nof\ncomplications\nreported\nto\nMAUDE for FDA 510(k) cleared SIJ fusion devices are user\nerror due to improper placement of implants. These complica-\ntions are likely underreported, and there is currently no formal\ntracking system of total SIJ fusions performed to calculate ac-\ncurate complication and revision rates. Patient injury and health\ncare costs can potentially be reduced with improved education,\ntraining, and oversight, which is currently lacking.\nKey Words: sacroiliac joint, fusion, complications\n(Clin Spine Surg 2022;35:E363–E367)\nT\nhe prevalence of low back pain originating from the\nsacroiliac joint (SIJ) is thought to range anywhere\nfrom 2% to 30%.1–4 The SIJs are mobile in all 3 anatomic\nplanes5–8 and have been shown to have intra-articular pain\ngenerators along with closely associated extra-articular\npain generators.9,10 When conservative treatment for SIJ\npain fails, arthrodesis becomes a viable option to reduce or\neliminate pain from this joint.\nThe number of SIJ fusions continues to be on an\nannually accelerating upward trend.11,12 There are many\ntechniques and hardware options for fusing the SIJ, with\nminimally invasive, Federal Drug Administration (FDA)\n510(k) cleared implants being the most utilized. The\ncomplication rate for minimally invasive SIJ arthrodesis\nhas been reported to be between 0% and 18%11–14 with\nrevision rates ranging from 0% to 6.3%.11,13–17 The ma-\njority of these studies are industry-sponsored and risk\nvarying degrees of bias.\nThe purpose of this study was to present an unbiased\nreport of the current rate of severe complications for FDA\n510(k) cleared SIJ fusion implants and to investigate the\nreported underlying cause of these complications. Our\nhypothesis was that most of the reported complications\nare technical errors, which if true, could potentially be\ndecreased with improved training, education, and over-\nsight in coordination with the major spine research and\nteaching societies and government institutions.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThe Manufacturer and User Facility Device Expe-\nrience (MAUDE) database is a passive surveillance system\nthat records medical device reports submitted by man-\ndatory and voluntary reporters of suspected device-\nassociated deaths, serious injuries, and malfunctions. This\nincludes complications reported in patients undergoing SIJ\nfusions using FDA 510(k) cleared devices. The MAUDE\ndatabase was searched in September 2020 using “Sacroil-\niac Joint Fixation” as the Product Class search criteria. A\nsingle reviewer (M.D.R.) manually screened all of the\nmedical device reports returned from the search. Several\ndata points, including manufacturer, brand name, date\nreport was received, event date, event type, device prob-\nlem, root cause, initial procedure, number of implants per\nside, time to correction, patient symptoms, complication,\ncorrective action, and outcome, were obtained from each\nreport and recorded.\nReceived for publication July 19, 2021; accepted September 15, 2021.\nFrom the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Western Michigan Uni-\nversity School of Medicine, Kalamazoo, MI.\nThe authors declare no conﬂict of interest.\nReprints: Michael D.

Fusion of the SIJ by total discharges\nwas searched from 2011 to 2017. The number of all fu-\nsions, including open, percutaneous, and endoscopic, were\nobtained and recorded.\nThe Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services\n(CMS) was also searched through the Medicare Provider\nUtilization and Payment Data: Physician and Other Supplier\nsystem. Physician and Other Supplier data from CY2012 to\nCY2017 was collected. A search for sacroiliac fusion was\nperformed, and information related to MD and DO sur-\ngeons was ﬁltered out. International Classiﬁcation of Disease\n(ICD-9 and ICD-10) codes 27280 and 27279 were used.\nTotal providers and the number of fusions (open and mini-\nmally invasive) were obtained and recorded by year.\nRESULTS\nThe MAUDE database was searched from the ﬁrst\nreport on June 30, 2011, through the last report on July\n28, 2020. A total of 1115 reports were identiﬁed. Duplicate\nreports and complications not involving the SIJ were re-\nmoved, leaving 1107 medical device reports. The number\nof reports per year steadily increased from 3 in 2009 to 120\nin 2014. Reports then increased again in 2017, plateauing\naround 150 reports until present (Fig. 1). Surgeon and\npatient demographics were not available in these reports.\nEight device manufacturers were included in the\nmedical device reports (Table 1). Patient injury was the\nmost common type of event reported at 97.5% (1080/1107).\nDeath was reported in 3 patients (0.3%). Malposition was\nthe most common device problem at 49.5% (548/1107). All\ncommon device problems are listed in Table 2. The root\ncause of these events was primarily user error at 58.2%\n(644/1107). The other root causes are listed in Table 3.\nUnilateral SIJ fusion was the initial procedure in 91.3%\n(1011/1107) of the medical device reports. Bilateral SIJ fusions,\nincluding\nstaged\nfusions,\nmade\nup\n6.6%\n(73/1107)\nof reports. Three implants per side were used in 911 procedures.\nThis was followed by 2 implants per side in 101 procedures.\nThe most common symptom reported by patients\nwas radicular pain (38%, 421/1107). This was followed by\nunspeciﬁed pain (25.7%, 284/1107) and SIJ pain (17.2%,\n190/1107). Time to reoperation occurred mostly between 1\nweek and 11 months (38.9%, 431/1107) (Table 4).\nThere were 1495 contributing complications reported\nin 1107 medical device reports. Complications were most\noften the result of an implant breeching the neuroforamen\nor sacral cortex with or without nerve impingement (34%,\n508/1495). The most common implant involved was the\nmost cranial implant (61.2%, 311/508). All complications\nare listed in Table 5.

Neither database provided information\non the indication for surgery or the type of device used.\nDISCUSSION\nThe MAUDE database tracks global complications to\ninclude FDA 510(k) cleared SIJ fusion devices marketed in\nthe United States. There were 1107 complications reported\nto MAUDE over an 11-year period that were considered\nsevere, with most causing patient injury. Of these compli-\ncations, 92.8% required reoperation. The current literature\nreports an overall low complication rate following minimally\ninvasive SIJ arthrodesis. This number ranges anywhere from\n0% to 18%.11–14 Revision and reoperation rates reported\nrange anywhere from 0% to 6.3% based on total SIJ\nfusions.11,13–17 Complications reported to MAUDE are\nconducted as passive surveillance. While the manufacturers\nof these devices are required to report all complications, the\nnumber of complications is likely underreported by up to\n35%.18 This is because reporting is voluntary for health care\nprofessionals, patients, and consumers. An active surveil-\nlance system would offer a more accurate representation of\ntrue complication numbers and reoperation rates.\nExacting an accurate number for the complication\nrate when using these FDA 510(k) cleared devices for SIJ\nfusions is difﬁcult because there is a complete lack of\nformal tracking for the number of SIJ fusions performed.\nCurrently, there is no database that tracks all SIJ fusions\nperformed in the United States. CMS does track SIJ fu-\nsions under their Provider Utilization and Payment Data\nsystem. From 2012 to 2017, their numbers show SIJ fu-\nsions increasing from 582 in 2012 to 1165 in 2017. A study\nby Schoell et al12 used the Humana database and found\nthat from 2007 to 2014, the number of SIJ fusions in-\ncreased from 14 in 2007 to 142 in 2014. Two SI-Bone\nsponsored studies showed that their product was im-\nplanted 31 times in 2009, and this steadily increased to\n3611 in 2012, while the overall number of fusions between\n2009 and 2014 was 11,820.11,19 The SI-Bone Web site re-\nports over 45,000 SIJ fusions since 2009 using their\nproduct.20 If ∼80% of SIJ fusions use SI-Bone’s iFuse\nsystem, a conservative estimate, it could be estimated that\n∼60,000 SIJ fusions may have been performed over the\ntime period in question. This would put the complication\nrate at about 2%. Due to likely underreporting to the\nMAUDE database, the true percentage is most likely\nmuch higher. The AHRQ also has the Hospital Inpatient\nNational Statistics that report fusion of the SIJ by total\nhospital discharges. They reported 3220 discharges in\n2016, followed by 3035 discharges in 2017. If these num-\nbers were to be hypothetically extrapolated out to include\nthe 10 years this study covers, the overall number of SIJ\nfusions would be far more, making the likely percentage of\ncomplications much higher. The American Spine Registry\ndoes not currently track SIJ fusions, making it impossible\nfor the major orthopedic, neurosurgery, and spine aca-\ndemies and societies to follow this data accurately. While\nthere is similarly no formal tracking of all of the SIJ fu-\nsions performed in the United States yearly, it can be seen\nthat with the available data, the number of SIJ fusions\nperformed each year continues to increase.\nGiven that an accurate number of SIJ fusions using\nFDA 510(k) cleared devices in the United States each year\ncannot be generated, the severe complications that have\nbeen reported are meaningful because they are occurring\nwith an increasing trend. They are altering patients’ lives\nand do result in death, morbidity, and many return trips to\nthe operating room. Therefore, these MAUDE reports are\nworth reviewing by those either directly impacted by them\nor in a position to make potential positive changes.\nThe root cause of the complications reported to\nMAUDE was user error at 58.2% (644/1107). The root\ncause was further broken down into speciﬁc complica-\ntions. Malposition of the implant(s) was the most common\ndevice problem reported at 49.5% (548/1107). This rate is\nslightly higher than the symptomatic malposition rate re-\nported by Cher et al19 at 38.4%. Complications were most\noften the result of an implant breeching the neuroforamen\nor sacral cortex with or without nerve impingement (34%,\n508/1495). The most common implant involved was the\nmost cranial implant (61.2%, 311/508). More than 50% of\nthe complications reported to MAUDE were due to sur-\ngeon error. Therefore, a signiﬁcant number of these\ncomplications were potentially avoidable. The available\ndata currently lacks speciﬁc surgeon demographics, so\nfurther categorization is not possible.\nReturning to the operating room for additional\nprocedures due to complications increases the cost to the\nhealth system. Overall, 92.8% of the complications re-\nported to MAUDE needed to return to the operating\nroom for an additional procedure. Of these, 9.5% re-\nquired reoperation within 1 week, and 38.9% returned to\nthe operating room between 1 week and 1 year. Childers\nand Maggard-Gibbons,21 recently showed that the cost\nof an inpatient operating room was $37.45 per minute. If\na separate trip is needed to return to the operating room,\nthen costs associated with this surgical procedure in-\ncrease drastically.\nFormal education regarding SIJ fusions is currently\nlacking, as there is no standard central institution within\nspine surgery or the government that provides surgical\neducation for the dysfunctional SIJ. Currently, the in-\ndustry and its surgeon surrogates deliver most of the\ntraining. Informal training from partners and other more\nexperienced surgeons is also common, with the under-\nstanding that they too have not been formally trained via a\nstandard educational protocol that is not proprietary.\nWith the increasing number of SIJ fusions each year and\nwith most of the complications reported being surgeon\nerror, an argument can be made that there needs to be\nformal training. Cher et al19 reported that revision rates\ndropped as the number of SIJ fusion cases performed in-\ncreased (6.0% down to 0.7%). In their study, 2.6% of\nsurgeons were responsible for 34% of revisions. While\nmore experience leads to fewer complications is a truism\nfor any surgery, formal training in SIJ fusions during\nresidency and fellowship is lacking and making this\nlearning curve steeper. With more education, training, and\nRahl et al\nClin Spine Surg \u0001 Volume 35, Number 3, April 2022\nE366 | www.clinicalspinesurgery.com\nCopyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

      "5": "experience, the number of complications and the need for\nreoperation should decrease. This lack of education\nand training is also reﬂected in the orthopedic and\nneurosurgery board examinations. Currently, there is\nnothing mentioned regarding the SIJ or SIJ fusion surgery\nin the American Board of Neurological Surgery board\npreparation Content Categories. The American Board of\nOrthopedic Surgery examination preparation Blueprint\nmentions that at least 1 question will address sacroiliac\ndysfunction but is not necessarily speciﬁc to fusions.\nWhile the numbers of complications reported to\nMAUDE are most likely less than the true value, this is\nthe ﬁrst analysis of all the available data on the 510(k)\ncleared devices being utilized for this purpose over a\nconsecutive 10-year period. An industry-sponsored study\nwas published in 2015 that looked speciﬁcally at their own\ndevice and MAUDE-reported complications.19 More\nstudies are needed to further evaluate the underlying\ncauses and true complication and revision rates following\nSIJ fusions. With the implementation of formal training\nand more transparent tracking systems, the number of\ncomplications should decrease, making this surgery much\nsafer for patients.\nThis study has several limitations. This is a retro-\nspective database analysis. While temporal trends, risk-\nstratiﬁcation, and cost-analysis are possible, there are few\nstudies available to validate these database ﬁndings and\ntheir inherent limitations.22 Data obtained for this study\nregarding SIJ fusion complications is from a passive sur-\nveillance system. Therefore, we believe complications from\nthis procedure are signiﬁcantly underreported. There is\ncurrently no standardized tracking system of total annual\nSIJ fusions performed. Therefore, accurate complication\nand reoperation rates are impossible to calculate. The best\navailable data was obtained, extrapolated, and analyzed for\noverall trends. More speciﬁc information regarding surgeon\nand patient demographics was not available to further an-\nalyze possible contributing factors to these complications.\nFinally, user error is a broad term. While more speciﬁc\ninformation was not available, it was determined that the\nroot cause of these complications was due to the person\nplacing the implant, not the device itself. SIJ fusions can be\ndifﬁcult, and the implants are not perfect.\nIn conclusion, the majority of complications reported\nto MAUDE for FDA 510(k) cleared SIJ fusion devices are\nfrom user error due to improper placement of implants.\nMany of these reported complications required a return to\nthe operating room for correction, which did not always\nresolve the symptoms resulting from those complications.\nThe complications reported and examined here are likely\nunderreported, and there is currently no formal tracking\nsystem of total SIJ fusions performed to calculate accurate\ncomplication and revision rates. Patient injury and health\ncare costs associated with these fusions can likely be re-\nduced with improved education, training, and oversight.\nREFERENCES\n1. Maigne JY, Aivakiklis A, Pfefer F.

The choice of whether to use these screws in combination with\na washer is still undecided. The aim of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical competence\nof S1-S2 sacroiliac (SI) screw fixation with and without using a washer across three different screw\ndesigns. Material and Methods: Twenty-four composite pelvises were used and an SI joint injury type\nAPC III according to the Young and Burgess classification was simulated. Fixation of the posterior pelvis\nring was performed using either partially threaded short screws, fully threaded short screws, or fully\nthreaded long transsacral screws. Biomechanical testing was performed under progressively increasing\ncyclic loading until failure, with monitoring of the intersegmental and bone-implant movements via\nmotion tracking. Results: The number of cycles to failure and the corresponding load at failure (N) were\nsignificantly higher for the fully threaded short screws with a washer (3972 ± 600/398.6 ± 30.0) versus\nits counterpart without a washer (2993 ± 527/349.7 ± 26.4), p = 0.026. In contrast, these two parameters\ndid not reveal any significant differences when comparing fixations with and without a washer using\neither partially threaded short of fully threaded long transsacral screws, p ≥0.359. Conclusions: From\na biomechanical perspective, a washer could be optional when using partially threaded short or fully\nthreaded long transsacral S1-S2 screws for treatment of posterior pelvis ring injuries in young trauma\npatients. Yet, the omission of the washer in fully threaded short screws could lead to a significant\ndiminished biomechanical stability.\nKeywords: biomechanics; motion tracking; posterior pelvis ring injury; S1-S2 sacroiliac screw ﬁxation;\nsynthetic pelvic bone model; transsacral ﬁxation; washer; washerless\n1. Introduction\nCannulated screws are the gold standard for percutaneous treatment of sacroiliac\n(SI) pelvis ring injuries [1,2]. A combined ﬁxation at both S1 and S2 levels via two SI\nscrews provides the best type of ﬁxation in case of a vertical pelvic instability [3,4]. Most\ncommon, screws of 6.5 mm or 7.3 mm diameter are used together with washers [5], the latter\nconsidered as advantageous regarding biomechanical ﬁxation enhancement [6]. While\nthere is a common agreement on the surgical treatment, the question of possible implant\nremoval (IR) remains controversial. Literature provides extensive data on IR rates following\nSI screw ﬁxation, amounting up to 57% in follow-up cohort studies [7]. Typical indications\nfor IR are screw malposition, non-union, screw loosening, as well as iatrogenic damage\nto the L5 level or sacral nerve roots [8–11]. A complete IR might be indicated in cases\nMedicina 2023, 59, 1379. https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina59081379\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/medicina\n",

However, complications following IR are common and range between 3 and\n20% [12–14]. The fusion of the SI joint, especially in young and active patients, must\nbe considered unphysiological. It was conversely stated that IR is justiﬁed in younger\npatients [7]. Some authors even recommend implant removal routinely [8,15]. Due to the\ndifﬁculty and proneness to intraoperative problems, the retrieval of the washer can be the\nmost demanding part of the surgery and constitute the longest part of the surgery [16,17].\nTherefore, Oberst et al. suggested an endoscopic IR in order to reduce x-ray exposure and\nsoft tissue damage [18]. Although young patients with predominantly physiological bone\nquality represent a clearly different patient clientele than geriatric patients, hardly any\nimplants are speciﬁcally designed to patient’s age. Although there are surgical procedures\nand techniques that are adapted to the age of the patient, most implants are generic. Hence,\nyoung patients could potentially beneﬁt from standard S1-S2 SI screw treatment excluding\nthe washer, especially in view of IR, where surgery time, blood loss, surgical exposure,\nradiation exposure, and complications could be signiﬁcantly lower. However, to our\nknowledge, the surgical method of S1-S2 SI screw ﬁxation of the posterior pelvis ring\nwithout the washer has never been evaluated biomechanically.\nPurpose\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the biomechanical competence of S1-S2 SI\nscrew ﬁxations, with and without using a washer, across three different screw designs—\n(1) partially threaded, (2) fully threaded short, or (3) fully threaded long transsacral SI\nscrews. The focus was to obtain a holistic picture of construct stability, including the one\nimmediately after instrumentation, as well as the temporal stability decay during dynamic\nloading, together with the ultimate construct endurance. In addition, relative movements\nbetween the two bone segments, between the screw and the ilium, as well as between the\nscrew tip and the sacrum were assessed. These parameters were speciﬁcally chosen given\nthe known common clinical failure modes associated with SI screw ﬁxation, namely screw\ncutout or loosening, resulting in eventual overall ﬁxation failure [19,20].\n2. Materials and Methods\nTwenty-four composite pelvises (Model 4060®, Synbone, Zizers, Switzerland) were\nused. An SI joint injury type APC III according to the Young and Burgess classiﬁcation was\nsimulated in all specimens [21]. To induce this injury, the material of the symphysis as well\nas the SI joint was removed, resulting in a total instability.\nSpecimens were stratiﬁed into three sets of two groups each for instrumentation as\nfollows (Figure 1):\nSet 1:\n•\nGroup PT w/: Fixation of the posterior pelvis ring with two 7.3 mm partially threaded\nshort cannulated self-tapping screws (lengths: 90 mm for S1 and 65 mm for S2) and\nwashers (diameter 13.0 mm, thickness 6.6 mm).\n•\nGroup PT w/o: Fixation of the posterior pelvis ring with two 7.3 mm partially threaded\nshort cannulated self-tapping screws (lengths: 90 mm for S1 and 65 mm for S2)\nwithout washers.\nSet 2:\n•\nGroup FT w/: Fixation of the posterior pelvis ring with two 7.3 mm fully threaded\nshort cannulated self-tapping screws (lengths: 90 mm for S1 and 65 mm for S2) and\nwashers (diameter 13.0 mm, thickness 6.6 mm).\n•\nGroup FT w/o: Fixation of the posterior pelvis ring with two 7.3 mm fully threaded\nshort cannulated self-tapping screws (lengths: 90 mm for S1 and 65 mm for S2)\nwithout washers.\n",

Inlet (uppercase letters) and outlet (lower case letters) x-rays after instrumentation showing\nspecimens from groups TS w/(A,a), TS w/o (B,b), FT w/(C,c), FT w/o (D,d), PT w/(E,e) and PT\nw/o (F,f).\nEqual numbers of three right and three left pelvis sides were utilized in each group\n(n = 6). The surgical treatment was performed according to the AO principles [22] as\nfollows. After reduction of the SI joints, the self-tapping screws were positioned over\na previously placed guidewires perpendicular to the SI joint, entirely within the artiﬁcial\nbone, avoiding any perforations. The insertion of the guidewires was performed with\na custom aiming guide, allowing a standardized placement through a single attempt\nwithout any perforations or cortical disturbances. First, the S1 SI screw was positioned,\nfollowed by the S2 SI screw. The screws ranged to the midline of the sacral vertebra in\ngroups PT w/, PT w/o, FT w/and FT w/o, and to the contralateral ilium cortex in groups\nTS w/and TS w/o, and were tightened according to the operator’s best judgment. Post\ninstrumentation, true lateral, inlet and outlet x-rays were captured to verify the positioning\nof the inserted screws (Figure 1).\nAll screws and washers were made of stainless steel (316LVM) and the same man-\nufacturer (DePuy Synthes, Zuchwil, Switzerland) provided all implants. The anterior\npelvis ring was cut by sawing the pelvic ramus at the middle of the shaft on the ipsilateral\nand contralateral sides, as this reﬂects the injury pattern under investigation. A qualiﬁed\nsurgeon operated all pelvises.\n2.1. Biomechanical Testing\nThe biomechanical testing procedure and equipment was described in a previous\nstudy [23]. The system was equipped with a 5 kN/50 Nm load cell, operating at less\nthan 1% accuracy within 10–100% loading capacity [24,25]. The setup with a specimen\n",

The ilium part of the examined anatomical side\nwas ﬁxed to the base of the machine using a vice, gripping the part of the ilium between\nthe ramus and the border of the acetabulum. Two custom polymethylmethacrylate blocks\nwere modelled for repeated use, ensuring a standardized clamping force applied by the\nvice on the clamped specimen region. Loading along the machine axis was applied to the\nsacrum with 41 mm anterior offset relative to the posterior-superior S1 endplate aspect,\ngenerating the required bending moment around the medio-lateral axis as calculated from\na previous inverse-dynamic gait analysis [19]. A custom steel plate with L-proﬁle was\nused for this purpose. The sacrum was attached to the vertically oriented side of the plate\nwith two screws inserted through its fourth foramen. The horizontal part of the plate was\nattached to the machine actuator through a cardan joint. Four retro-reﬂective marker sets\nwere attached to the sacrum, the iliac crest and both SI screws for optical motion tracking.\n \nFigure 2. Setup with a specimen mounted for biomechanical testing.

Data Acquisition & Analysis\nMachine data in terms axial displacement and axial load were continuously obtained\nfrom the machine transducer and the load cell throughout testing, respectively. On this\nbasis, construct stiffness was evaluated from the ascending load–displacement curve of the\ninitial quasi-static ramp.\nThe three-dimensional coordinates of all optical markers were continuously recorded\nidentically as described before [26]. Based on the motion tracking data, the following\n",
      "5": "Medicina 2023, 59, 1379\n5 of 11\nparameters of interest were evaluated: (1) gap angle, deﬁned as the combined angular\ndisplacement of the sacrum in coronal and horizontal plane relative to the ilium; (2) ﬂexion,\ndeﬁned as the angular ﬂexion displacement of the sacrum relative to the ilium; (3) screw\ntilt ilium, deﬁned as the angular displacement of the S1 screw relative to the ilium and\n(4) screw tip cutout, deﬁned as the translational displacement of the S1 screw tip relative\nto the sacrum in the plane perpendicular to the screw axis. The outcome measures were\nevaluated at three time points of cyclic testing after 1000, 2000, and 3000 cycles, under\nmaximal load of the respective cycle and relative to the beginning of the cyclic test. The\nlatter number represented the highest rounded number of cycles when none of the spec-\nimens had failed. Reaching 5◦gap angle was arbitrary set as a clinically relevant failure\ncriterion, and the corresponding number of cycles until its fulﬁllment under maximal load\nof the corresponding cycle—deﬁned as cycles to failure—was calculated together with the\ncorresponding maximal load, deﬁned as load at failure.\nStatistical analysis was performed with SPSS software (v.27, IBM SPSS, Armonk,\nNY, USA). Normality of data distribution was screened and proved with Shapiro–Wilk\ntest. Signiﬁcant differences between the group pairs within each set (using same screw\ndesign) regarding construct stiffness, cycles to failure and load at failure were detected with\nIndependent-Samples t-test. General Linear Model Repeated Measures test was conducted\nto identify signiﬁcant differences between the group pairs within each set with regard to\nthe parameters of interest evaluated over the time points after 1000, 2000, and 3000 test\ncycles. Level of signiﬁcance was set at 0.05 for all statistical tests.\n3.

Cycles to failure (left abscissa) and corresponding load at failure (right abscissa), presented\nfor each separate group in terms of mean value and SD. Star indicates signiﬁcant differences between\nthe groups.\n4. Discussion\nThe goal of this study was to assess the stability of standard S1-S2 SI screw ﬁxations,\nwith and without using a washer, across different screw designs. It was hypothesized that\nin good bone quality the omission of the washer would result in equivalent biomechanical\nstability. The following two main important points can be identiﬁed:\n1.\nPartially threaded short and fully threaded long transsacral screws demonstrated\nequivalent biomechanical stability under dynamic loading disregarding whether\na washer was used or not.\n2.\nOmission of the washer led to a signiﬁcantly diminished biomechanical stability under\ndynamic loading with fully threaded short screws.\nThe surgical therapy of the qualiﬁed groups in the presented study is regularly used\nin clinical practice [27–29]. However, previous work could not reveal signiﬁcant differences\nbetween the different types of SI screw ﬁxation [27,30,31]. In contrast, the experimental set-\nting in the current investigation seems to be relevant to detect even the smallest differences\nin biomechanical behavior between the groups, such as the choice of washer inclusion.\nThe routine use of a washer for ﬁxation of the posterior pelvis ring seems to be at\nthe discretion of the treating surgeon and is scarcely discussed in the current literature.\nTherefore, an investigation is clearly difﬁcult due to the lack of studies. A recent review and\nexpert opinion concerning transsacral screw ﬁxation of posterior pelvis ring injuries does\nnot cover this topic in any manner and only devotes a single sentence to it: “We routinely\nutilize a washer if there is fracture displacement” [6,32].\nA comparable study, using fully threaded 7.3 mm sacroiliac S1 screws, described\nwasher penetration in the iliac bone [19]. In our study, no penetration of the screw heads\nor washers into the cortices of the bone model occurred in any group. According to\nthe operator’s judgement, the screws with and without washer could be tightened with\ncomparable strength. This seems to be reﬂected in the results with comparable initial\nconstruct stiffness between the ﬁxations using the same screw design with and without\na washer, yet with signiﬁcantly higher stiffness in group PT w/versus group PT w/o.\nCharacteristically, the initial stiffness of partially threaded screws with a washer was\nhigher, although this supposed advantage seems to be eliminated during dynamic loading,\nat least to the point where the screw head eventually breaks into the cortex. With fully\nthreaded short screws on the other hand, it was demonstrated that although the initial\nstiffness was comparable, the advantages of using a washer only become apparent during\ndynamic loading.\n",
      "8": "Medicina 2023, 59, 1379\n8 of 11\nWashers are known as safeguards against screw intrusion as well as a technique\nto retain compressive force after screw intrusion [6]. Furthermore, they are a standard\ncomponent in the iliosacral screw placement recommendations from the AO [22]. Yet,\nthere is little data on over-compression of the SI joints in the literature. Most authors\nmerely describe that this should be avoided [32–34]. It has further been reported as\na disadvantage that ﬁxation of posterior SI joint dislocations with transiliac sacral bars,\nincluding over-compression of the ilium, may lead to damage to the sacral nerves [35].\nA different study regarding this topic recommends cannulated 7.3 mm partially threaded\nscrews with a washer, however, fully threaded washerless screws may be preferred to avoid\nover-compression of a sacral fracture in case of comminution [34].\nA transiliac ﬁxator for treatment of comminuted sacrum fractures has the potential for\nhigher stiffness with a lower risk of over-compression [36]. However, judging the quality\nof reduction is difﬁcult and there is a risk of over-compression with nerve injury when\na sacral fracture is present [37].\nThe amount of applied compression seems to be left to the experience of the surgeon.\nThe judgement of the treating operator should be utilized to avoid over-compression of the\nfracture of the posterior pelvis ring [32]. The same competence should be attributed with\nregard to screw intrusion. In addition, this previous investigation found that there were\nno signiﬁcant differences between the treatment groups in terms of gap angle and screw\ntilt in the ilium, suggesting that in young patients, the exclusion of the washer seems to be\nfeasible. However, the current study demonstrated signiﬁcantly higher values for these\ntwo parameters of interest (gap angle and screw tilt in ilium) in group FT w/o compared\nto group FT w/. In addition, the number of cycles to failure and load at failure were\nsigniﬁcantly higher in the latter versus the former group. In our test setup, the symphysis\nwas not ﬁxed, as it might happen in a clinical situation [3].\nA biomechanical study investigating cement augmentation of SI screws concluded that\nbilateral bone implant anchorage was the signiﬁcantly more important factor concerning\nfracture displacement than the actual number of inserted screws [37]. It has further been\nstated that longer screws achieve higher stability than shorter screws [3].\nStrength & Limitations\nThe obvious limitation of this investigation is the chosen artiﬁcial bone model. This\nmakes the simulation of ligament injuries of the pelvis, as well as screw intrusion, difﬁcult.\nThough, as this is an innovative study with a debatable approach, for which there is limited\ndata available and an unpredictable outcome, the authors agreed to the artiﬁcial specimens\nas a ﬁrst step approach. Following a successful ﬁrst artiﬁcial bone study, it is ethically\nacceptable to proceed with a cadaver investigation. Further, the investigated injury was\npurposely chosen to provide an absolute unstable situation representing the worst-case\nscenario. Therefore, the missing ligaments in the chosen specimens could be disregarded\nin the performed test series.\nFurthermore, artificial pelvises allow standardized experimental groups, which can\noverpower innumerable differences in the bone quality of human cadavers and are also more\ncost-effective [38–41]. Specifically, when investigating the pelvis, artificial bone specimens\nhave been repeatedly and effectively used in many biomechanical studies [31,38,42–44].\nMoreover, the accessibility of cadavers is not only limited, but the specimens are also costly,\nboth of which can influence the sample size of biomechanical research. It is already recognized\nthat the sample sizes used in earlier publications are in general small [45]. While the sample\nsize in this investigation was moderately small, it is equivalent to comparable biomechanical\nstudies investigating posterior pelvis fixation techniques [31,42–44,46]. Missing torque data on\nthe tightening force of the screws with and without washers is another limitation. However,\nsince all screws were implanted by the same experienced surgeon and there was no screw\nhead or washer penetration into the bone, it can be assumed that all screws were tightened\nwith a comparable strength. Finally, the witnessed failure modes, fracturing of the ilium in\nbetween the ilium fixation and S2 SI screw, seem to be far from clinically relevancy, especially\n",

Therefore, the bones used may not have been able to properly simulate\ncertain screw loosening effects, e.g., cut-through of the proximal screw part into the cortex.\nNevertheless, the knowledge gained can serve as a basis for further research on different bone\nmodels or cadaveric bones.\n5. Conclusions\nFrom a biomechanical perspective, a washer could be optional when using partially\nthreaded short or fully threaded long transsacral S1-S2 screws for treatment of posterior pelvis\nring injuries in young trauma patients. Yet, the omission of the washer in fully threaded\nshort screws could lead to a significantly diminished biomechanical stability. Additional\nbiomechanical cadaveric studies should be initiated for a reliable interpretation of washerless\nfixations and their potential for the therapy of the injured posterior pelvis ring.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, T.B., T.P., S.H., B.G. and H.-C.P.; methodology, T.B., P.S.,\nB.G. and H.-C.P.; data collection, T.B., I.Z. and T.P.; analysis, I.Z., P.S., S.H. and T.P.; writing—original\ndraft preparation, T.B., I.Z., P.S. and S.H.; writing—review and editing, T.P., S.H., G.R. and B.G.;\nsupervision, G.R., B.G. and H.-C.P.; project administration, T.B., G.R., B.G. and H.-C.P.

The iFuse \nImplant System® is a permanent implant used to perform minimally invasive sacroiliac joint \nfusion. The purpose of this study is to determine the surgical revision rate after sacroiliac joint \nfusion surgery with this system.\nMethods: Using two internal sources of information, revision surgeries were identified and \nlinked to index surgeries. The likelihood of revision surgery was calculated using the Kaplan–\nMeier life table approach. Predictors of revision were explored.\nResults: Four-year survivorship free from implant revision was 96.46%. Revision rate did \nnot differ by sex and was lower for age .65. In all, 24% of revisions occurred within the first \n30 days after surgery; 63.5% occurred within year 1. Implant survivorship has improved annu­\nally since the device was introduced in 2009.\nConclusion: The survivorship rate with this implant is high and improving; the rate is somewhat \nhigher than total hip replacement but lower than that of lumbar spine procedures.\nKeywords: safety, sacroiliac joint fusion, iFuse Implant System, revision\nIntroduction\nThe safety and effectiveness of devices used to treat medical conditions are of key \nconcern to physicians, patients, and payors. Several regulatory pathways are available \nfor the commercialization of medical devices in the US. In some cases, devices may \nbe commercialized without the need for premarket clinical data. Even when premarket \nclinical data are required, trial sample sizes may be too small to detect rare events. \nConsequently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires postmarket \nsurveillance to maintain a reasonable assurance of safety for all medical devices.\nKey components of postmarket surveillance include complaint handling1 and \nreporting of events through the Medical Device Reporting regulation (Code of Federal \nRegulations, Title 21, Part 803).2 The former requires a manufacturer to maintain a \nrecord of all complaints of which the manufacturer becomes aware. Complaints are \ndefined broadly as any “communication that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, \nquality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness or performance” of the device.2 The \nlatter requires manufacturers, importers, and device user facilities (eg, hospitals, sur­\ngical facilities, and other health care sites of service) to report certain device-related \nadverse events as well as product issues (ie, complaints) to the US FDA.\nPostmarket tracking of medical device complaints and adverse events can help to \nuncover risks not foreseen or not quantifiable in the premarket setting.3 Data reported \nthrough both of these systems have led to the detection of unanticipated complications \nNumber of times this article has been viewed\nThis article was published in the following Dove Press journal: \nMedical Devices: Evidence and Research\n23 November 2015\n",

Until recently, surgical options have involved decor­\ntication of the SI joint and permanent fixation using screws \nand plates during an open surgical procedure.9 More recently, \nseveral devices for minimally invasive SI joint fusion have \nbecome commercially available. Most of the published litera­\nture reports the use of the iFuse Implant System® (SI-BONE, \nInc., San Jose, CA, USA). The iFuse Implant System includes \na delivery system to place a series of triangular titanium \nimplants coated with a porous titanium plasma spray across \nthe SI joint using a lateral, transarticular approach under \nfluoroscopic guidance.10 In the US, iFuse Implant System \nis intended for sacroiliac fusion for conditions including \nsacroiliac joint dysfunc­tion that is a direct result of sacroiliac \njoint disruption and degenerative sacroiliitis. This includes \nconditions in which symptoms began during pregnancy or in \nthe peripartum period and have persisted postpartum for more \nthan 6 months. In other geographies, iFuse Implant System is \nindicated for sacroiliac joint fusion. Placement of the implants \ndoes not require full decortication of the joint, as is done in \nother joint fusion procedures. The implant’s shape allows for \nimmediate stabilization of the joint and the titanium plasma \nspray coating allows for biologic fixation in bone.\nAs with other permanent implants placed surgically, the \nrate of surgical revision is a key outcome. Revision surgery \nin patients who undergo iFuse implant placement can occur \nearly, typically as a result of neural impingement due to \nmalposition, or late due to persistent or recurrent pain. Late \npain could be due to implant loosening or failure to achieve \nbony fusion. Revision surgery can entail implant removal or \nrepositioning, as well as placement of additional implants or \nother types of interventions.\nRevision after minimally invasive SI joint fusion using \nthe iFuse Implant System appears to be uncommon in both \nmid- and long-term published case series,11–15 as well as in \ntwo recently completed multi-center prospective trials.16,17 An \naccurate estimate of the revision rate, as well as monitoring \nany changes in the rate, requires a large number of patients \nand extended follow-up. In this report, we combine informa­\ntion from company-maintained inventory management and \ncomplaints databases to estimate the revision rate after SI joint \nfusion. We compare the revision rate observed in the commer­\ncial setting to those reported in two ongoing prospective clini­\ncal trials (INSITE: NCT01681004, and SIFI: NCT01640353), \nas well as to rates reported with other orthopedic implants.\nMethods\nTwo databases were used for the current analysis: inventory \nmanagement and complaints. Since 2009, key data captured for \nsurgeries using the iFuse Implant System have been recorded in \nan inventory database. These elements include a unique iden­\ntifier, procedure date, institution, operating surgeon, implant \ncatalog and lot number, and patient sex and age.\nIn addition, as part of standard postmarket surveillance, \nthe company records and investigates all reported complaints \nrelated to the device, regardless of source or mechanism \nof communication, and stores this information in a data­\nbase.1 Received complaints are individually evaluated for \nreportability as required by the US FDA’s Medical Device \nReporting regulation as well as international regulations.2 \nInstitutional review board approval was not required for this \nstudy as it was based on an analysis of internal company data \nroutinely collected during postmarket surveillance.\nEach complaint was manually reviewed and classified \naccording to whether or not it represented a surgical revision. \nWhen further information was required, the operating physi­\ncian was contacted by telephone or email. For the purpose \nof this study, a revision is defined as the occurrence of an \nadditional surgical procedure on an SI joint treated with the \niFuse Implant System for primary SI joint fusion. Index cases \nthat were inconsistent with the device’s labeled instructions \nfor use (eg, revision of a failed primary SI joint procedure \nthat used a different implant system) were excluded prior to \nanalysis. Types of revision procedures included: a removal or \nrepositioning of the originally placed implant(s), placement \nof additional implant(s), the use of non-iFuse implants to \nprovide additional fixation of the originally treated joint, or \nthe surgical debridement and grafting of the SI joint with or \nwithout changes to any of the implants. Each revision case \nin the complaints database was then manually linked to the \ncorresponding index (ie, initial) surgery in the inventory-\ntracking database.\nThe likelihood of revision after surgery was calculated \nusing the Kaplan–Meier life table approach. Time to revi­\nsion was calculated as the difference in dates between the \nindex surgery and the first revision surgery. For analysis \npurposes, inventory data were censored as of July 15, 2014. \nFollow-up was censored as of July 15, 2015. This ensured \nthat all treated patients had at least 1-year follow-up. Patient \nvital status information was not available and not collected; \ntherefore, survivorship rates do not account for death due \nto other causes. Given the relatively young mean age of \npatients undergoing this procedure (55.8), expected overall \nsurvival is high and lack of vital status information is not \nexpected to meaningfully affect calculated rates.

The proportion of simultaneous second sides was \nlow (432/10,956; 3.9%). In five cases, a surgeon who had not \nperformed the initial surgery performed the revision surgery \nand was unable to provide information on the surgeon who \nperformed the index surgery. These cases were excluded, \nwhich results in a slight underestimate of the revision rate \n(see “Results” section). Revision surgeries were classified \nby cause: 1) symptomatic malposition (SM), 2) symptom \nrecurrence (SR), with or without implant loosening, 3) per­\nsistent pain, 4) infection, 5) fracture, or 6) early revision for \nasymptomatic implant malposition.\nDifferences in time to revision were compared using the \nlog-rank statistic. Subgroup analyses were performed: patient \nage (by decades), sex, unilateral or bilateral surgery, year index \nsurgery was performed, and surgeon. For the purposes of this \nanalysis, bilateral surgery is used to describe fusion of both SI \njoints in the same surgery and does not include patients who \nunderwent staged bilateral surgery where the two SI joints are \nfused in separate surgeries. When subgroup information was \nunavailable, analyses excluded missing values.\nOf interest were reasons for changes in revision rates over \ntime. Minimally invasive spinal surgery is known to have \na learning curve; perioperative metrics and complications \nimprove with experience.18 We examined surgeon learning \ncurve using two methods. First, we ordered surgeon experi­\nence by case number (ie, 1st, 2nd, 3rd … 150th case, etc). \nAmong surgeons who had performed at least 100 cases, we \ndetermined whether the likelihood of revision decreased with \nincreased experience (grouping cases by case number: 1–20, \n21–50, 51–100, or .100) with the surgery/device. Second, \nfor surgeons who had performed at least 20 cases, we exam­\nined revision rates in the first 20 cases over time categorized \naccording to the year the surgeon’s first case was performed. \nObserved improvement over time in this second analysis \ncould be attributed in part to improved training.\nFor the per-surgeon analysis, significant differences seen \nas a result of the log-rank test were investigated further as \nfollows. The ratio of observed cases to expected cases (an \noutput parameter of the log-rank test) was determined. Since \nrandom sampling alone can cause an elevated observed/\nexpected ratio, the lower confidence limit of the ratio was \ncalculated using an exact Poisson method.19 Surgeons with \nobserved/expected ratios whose lower confidence limit \nexceeded 1 were tabulated.\nAll analyses focused on surgeries and revisions in the US \nonly. Since the number of surgeries performed in 2009 was \nsmall, revision rates are not reported beyond 4 years. The \nrevision rate observed in the entire database was compared \nwith revisions occurring during two ongoing prospective \nclinical trials (Sacroiliac Joint Fusion With iFuse Implant \nSystem, SIFI, NCT01640353 and Investigation of Sacroiliac \nFusion Treatment, INSITE, NCT01681004) as well as several \nretrospective studies reported in the literature.11,12,21,22\nAll calculations were performed using R.20 Exact Poisson \ntests were performed using the “exactci” package (version \n1.3-1, http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/exactci/exactci.\npdf).\nResults\nBetween April 2009 and July 15, 2014, 11,416 cases of MIS SI \njoint fusion with iFuse Implant System took place in the US. \nOf these, 28 were excluded because their use was inconsistent \nwith the manufacturer’s instructions for use. Of the 11,388 \nremaining, 10,956 (96.2%) cases were unilateral, 432 (3.8%) \ncases were simultaneous bilateral (ie, both sides treated in the \nsame operation), resulting in a total of 11,820 sides treated.\nPatients who underwent SI joint fusion using the iFuse \nimplant were predominantly female (58.9%, Table 1); mean \nage was 55.8 and 22% were over the age of 65. The number of \nsurgeries performed increased per year. In the majority of uni­\nlateral cases (89.6%), three implants were used. Similarly, six \nimplants (three per side) were used in 87% of bilateral cases.\nDuring the estimated 336,332 patient-side-months \n(28,027 patient-side-years) of follow-up, 320 revisions \noccurred. In five cases, the revision surgery could not be \nlinked to a particular index surgery. Overall, 24% of revi­\nsion surgeries occurred in the first month and 63% occurred \nwithin the first 12 months (Table 2).\nThe 4-year survival rate free from revision surgery was \n96.46% (cumulative revision rate of 3.54%). Adjusting for \nthe inability to match five revision cases to index surger­\nies, the adjusted 4-year survival rate was 96.40% (adjusted \nrevision rate of 3.60%). The revision rate improved substan­\ntially over time (log-rank P,0.0001, Figure 1), with 1-year \nrevision rates of 9.7%, 4.9%, 2.0%, 1.8%, 1.5%, and 1.4% \nduring 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively \n(P,0001). Because revision rates have fallen over time, the \nobserved 4-year revision rate (3.55%) probably overestimates \nthe actual current 4-year rate.\nThe most common reasons for revision surgery were SM \n(38.4%) and SR (47.6%). The majority (86.8%) of revisions \nfor SM occur within the first 6 months, while most (87.9%) \nrevisions for SR occur after month 6. The 4-year probability \nof revision due to SM was 1.0%; the 4-year probability of \nrevision due to SR was 1.94%. Revision rates for both con­\nditions improved over time (P,0.0001 for SM, P=0.0118 \n",

In the more recent time period (2012–present, \nFigure 2), the cumulative 2-year risk of revision was ∼2.5%; \n0.9% for SM and 1.07% for SR.\nKaplan–Meier analysis was used to evaluate other factors \npotentially predictive of the likelihood of revision. Revision \nrates were slightly higher with young age (P=0.024) but did \nnot vary by sex (P=0.193). The number of bilateral revision \ncases (n=10) was too small to determine a meaningful effect. \nRevision rate varied by index surgeon (P,0.0001). Taking \ninto account the numbers of index surgeries and follow-up \ntime, each surgeon’s ratio of observed to expected revisions \nwas calculated, along with confidence intervals and the ratio \nof observed/expected. In all, 22 surgeons (3.2% of all sur­\ngeons) had observed/expected ratios that were statistically \nelevated (ie, the lower confidence limit of the exact Poisson \nconfidence interval exceeded 1); 110 revision surgeries were \nassociated with these 22 surgeons, constituting 34.8% of all \nTable 2 Characteristics of revisions (n=315); cases that could \nnot be linked are excluded\nCharacteristic\nN (%)\nSex\n  Female\n  Male\n  Unknown\n\n187 (59.2)\n69 (21.9)\n59 (18.7)\nAge\n  ,25\n  25–35\n  35–45\n  45–55\n  55–65\n  .65\n  Unknown\n\n5 (1.6)\n22 (7.0)\n51 (16.2)\n61 (19.4)\n51 (16.2)\n45 (14.3)\n80 (25.4)\nYear of index surgery\n  2009\n  2010\n  2011\n  2012\n  2013\n  2014\n\n4 (1.3)\n19 (6.0)\n63 (20.0)\n95 (30.2)\n95 (30.2)\n39 (12.4)\nReason for revision\n  Symptomatic malposition\n  Recurrence of symptoms\n  Never improved\n  Fracture of ilium\n  \u0007Early revision for asymptomatic \nimplant malposition\n\n121 (38.4)\n150 (47.6)\n29 (9.2)\n3 (1.0)\n12 (3.8)\nMonths to revision\n  Same day\n  ,1\n  1–3\n  3–6\n  6–12\n  12–24\n  24–36\n  .36\n\n10 (3.2)\n67 (21.3)\n26 (8.3)\n31 (9.8)\n66 (21.0)\n82 (26.0)\n24 (97.6)\n9 (2.9)\nNote: *Data cut-off at July 15, 2014.\nTable 1 Information from commercial database (n=11,388)\nCharacteristic\nN (%)\nSex\n  Female\n  Male\n  Unknown\n\n6,709 (58.9)\n2,961 (26.0)\n1,718 (15.1)\nAge\n  ,25\n  25–35\n  35–45\n  45–55\n  55–65\n  .65\n  Unknown\n\n102 (0.9)\n588 (5.2)\n1,565 (13.7)\n2,399 (21.1)\n2,056 (18.1)\n2,512 (22.1)\n2,166 (19.0)\nYear of surgery\n  2009\n  2010\n  2011\n  2012\n  2013\n  2014*\n\n31 (0.3)\n256 (2.2)\n1,254 (11.0)\n3,163 (27.8)\n4,256 (37.4)\n2,428 (21.3)\nUnilateral\nBilateral\n10,956 (96.2)\n432 (3.8)\nNumber of implants\n  Unavailable\n  Unilateral surgeries\n    2\n    3\n    4\n    5\n  Bilateral surgeries\n    4\n    5\n    6\n    7\n    8\nAll\n\n313 (2.7)\n\n701\n9,545\n409\n1\n\n67\n15\n322\n7\n8\n11,388\nNote: *Data cut-off at July 15, 2014.\nrevisions, yet these surgeons accounted for only 5.4% of \nindex cases performed.\nFor the 25 surgeons who had performed more than \n100 cases, cases were divided by case number into cases 1–20, \n21–50, 51–100, and .100.

A key feature \nof long-term safety is the need for a revision surgery, an \noutcome of importance to the patient, surgeon, and payor. \nRevision rate is a well-accepted endpoint in much of the \northopedic literature.\nOur analysis of revision rates associated with the use of \niFuse Implant System showed several key findings. First, \nthe revision rate calculated in the nonclinical trial (ie, com­\nmercial) setting was similar to that observed in two ongoing \nprospective trials. The observed rate fell within the values \nreported in the published literature (which constitutes a sub­\nsample of the entire cohort we report herein).11,13–15,21,23\n",

For example, in total hip replacement, a mature \ntechnology and surgical procedure, recent figures from Europe \nindicate 4-year revision rates of ,2%;24,25 in the US, revision \nrates might be higher (4% at 4 years).26 In a retrospective \ncohort analysis of Medicare claims, 4-year revision rates after \nlumbar stenosis surgery (decompression or arthrodesis) for \nlumbar stenosis were 10.6% and 17.2% for patients without \nand with prior surgery, respectively.27 The 4-year revision rate \nwas 10.7% after simple lumbar arthrodesis and 13.5% after \ncomplex lumbar arthrodesis; device-related complications \nwere reported for 29.2% of the reoperations. An analysis of \ndischarge registry data from nonfederal acute care hospitals \nin Washington state revealed 4-year cumulative revision rates \nof 10%–20% for surgery related to a primary diagnosis of \nherniated disc, degenerative disc disease, or spondylolisthe­\nsis.28 The 4-year revision rate for lumbar discectomy, a widely \naccepted surgical treatment for disc herniation, was 13.8%; \nthis reoperation rate varied by surgeon.29 The 5-year revision \nrate reported from the CHARITÉ lumbar disc replacement \ninvestigational device exemption (IDE) trial was 7.7%.30 \nUsing the US Nationwide Inpatient Sample, the 2-year revi­\nsion burden for lumbar disc replacement (ie, the proportion of \ndisc replacement procedures that are revisions) was estimated \nat 11.2%.31 A European study of revisions after lumbar disc \nreplacement noted a 10.5% revision rate of the target area at \na mean of 8 years after initial surgery (not counting surgery \nfor adjacent segment degeneration).32 In comparison to other \ncommonly performed spine surgeries, the revision rate of \n3.6% after MIS SI joint fusion using the iFuse Implant System \nappears relatively low.\nRevisions after MIS SI joint fusion fell predominantly \ninto two categories: SM or SR. SM typically manifests as \nnew pain down the ipsilateral leg as a result of impingement \nof the device on local spinal nerve root(s). Not surprisingly, \nrevisions for SM typically occur within the first 30 days after \ndevice placement. In fact, 24% of all revisions occurred \nin the first 30 days, primarily due to SM. SR may develop \nwhen implant placement does not provide sufficient long-\nterm stabilization of the joint. Evaluations of these patients \ncommonly show that one or more of the implants did not \nadequately cross the joint and engage the sacrum. Thus, \nrevisions for SR generally occur after longer time periods \ncompared to SM. In all, 63% of all revisions occurred within \nthe first year after implant placement. Overall, however, the \nimplant revision rate was fairly low. Additional potential \nexplanations for late revisions include implant loosening or \nfailure to achieve bony fusion. These details are not routinely \ncollected during standard postmarket surveillance and their \noccurrence in clinical trials has been uncommon.\nFailures of surgical procedures involving implants can fall \ninto three broad categories: surgeon factors, device factors, \nor patient factors. In our analysis, no revision was attributed \nto implant failure (ie, breakage). During the time period \nunder study, there were neither major changes to the physical \ncharacteristics of the iFuse device nor improvements in the \ndelivery system; thus, these factors are unlikely to contribute \nto differential risks of implant revision. Our analysis showed \nthat older patients were somewhat less likely to undergo \nrevision, possibly because of increased overall surgical risks \nin older populations or competing mortality. Revision rate \ndid not vary by sex.\nSurgeon experience is often a factor in the risk of adverse \nevents, including revision surgery.33 In addition, the learn­\ning curve for most minimally invasive spinal procedures \nhas been shown to be relatively long.34–36 Our analysis sug­\ngests that surgeon experience may play a role with the iFuse \nimplant procedure. Overall, revision rates after MIS SI joint \nfusion using the iFuse device decreased markedly over time. \nRevisions for SM, typically resulting from incorrect device \nplacement, also diminished over time. For surgeons who had \nperformed .100 cases, 12-month revision rates were lower \nfor the 100th + case (0.74%) versus the first 20 cases (1.6%). \nIn addition, in all surgeons’ first 20 cases, 12-month revision \nrates progressively decreased over time, with the lowest rates \nduring 2013. These findings suggest improvements in surgeon \ntechnique with increased experience and perhaps improved \nphysician training over time. In our analysis, a small number \nof surgeons (2.6% of all surgeons) accounted for 34% of all \nrevisions, suggesting that surgeon proficiency may be a factor \nin risk of revision. Variation in surgeon expertise may play a \nrole in other procedures.28,33\nThe strengths of this study are three-fold. First, the \nnumber of index surgeries performed is captured with high \nfidelity in our inventory database as both implants and \ninstruments are ordered and purchased directly through the \ncompany. Second, a company representative is nearly always \nin attendance for both index procedures and revisions. Third, \nalthough revision is uncommon, because it is an important \nclinical outcome, and because specialized iFuse instrumenta­\ntion is typically used during a revision surgery, the occurrence \nof a revision surgery is likely to be reported to the company \nwith relatively high fidelity.\nOur investigation has several limitations. Patient charac­\nteristics, other than age and sex, were unavailable, limiting \n",

Although only a small number of known \nrevision surgeries could not be linked to index surgeries, the \nanalysis may not accurately account for all revision surgeries. \nIt is possible that a surgeon not familiar with or trained in \nthe use of the iFuse Implant System performed a revision \nsurgery but failed to report it to the company. It is also pos­\nsible that revisions took place that involved procedures (eg, \nbone grafting, placement of alternative devices) that were not \nreported to or detected by the company; this could result in \nan underreporting of revision rates. In five cases (1.6% of all \nrevision cases), we were aware that a revision surgery took \nplace but unable to link the revision to an index surgery; this \nresults in a small underestimation of the cumulative prob­\nability of revision. Our analysis is based on data from year \n2009 through 2014. In the earlier time period, the number of \nindex surgeries was comparatively small. The 4-year revision \nrates are therefore based on a follow-up of a relatively small \nnumber of patients. However, since revision rates have fallen \nover time, the reported 3.5% rate is conservative; the actual \ncurrent 4-year rate is likely to be lower.\nOur analysis does not include death due to other causes, \nwhich would result in censoring of observations. Whether \nsuch censoring would result in increases or decreases in the \ncalculated revision rate is not known.\nFinally, some patients who have inadequate pain relief \nafter SI joint fusion may undergo treatment for another \ncondition. Our analysis does not capture these patients as \nthe procedure provided is not an SI joint revision surgery. \nClinical failure rates are best estimated from ongoing pro­\nspective studies of SI joint fusion.\nDespite these limitations, our investigation demonstrates \nthe value of postmarket surveillance via monitoring manu­\nfacturer complaints. Moreover, because index surgeries and \nrevisions are likely captured with high fidelity, we believe \nour analysis gives a fair representation of revision rates after \nMIS SI joint fusion using the iFuse Implant System.\nConclusion\nThe cumulative rate of revision surgery after SI joint fusion \nusing the iFuse Implant System was 3.6% at 4 years. This \ncompares favorably with revision rates for other common \northopedic procedures, being somewhat higher than a mature \northopedic technology (total hip replacement) but less than \ncommonly performed lumbar spine surgeries. The revision \nrate improved annually from 2009, possibly related to a \nsurgeon learning curve or improved training.\nAuthor contributions\nAll authors contributed toward data analysis, drafting and \nrevising the paper and agree to be accountable for all aspects \nof the work.\nDisclosure\nAll authors are SI-BONE employees.
