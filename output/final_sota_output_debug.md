# 1. Introduction

The sacroiliac (SI) joint is a significant source of low back pain, with fusion becoming a viable option when conservative treatments fail (Rahl et al., 2022). The increasing number of SIJ fusions highlights the importance of understanding the biomechanical aspects of the procedures (Rahl et al., 2022). Current knowledge gaps exist regarding the optimal techniques and components used in SI joint fusion, particularly concerning the use of washers with screws (Berk et al., 2023). This review aims to address these gaps by analyzing the biomechanical efficacy of washers in SI joint fusion. This review will focus on the biomechanical performance of SI screw fixation, specifically evaluating the impact of using washers across different screw designs in the context of posterior pelvis ring injuries (Berk et al., 2023). The review is structured to provide a comprehensive overview of the clinical context, biomechanical principles, device characteristics, and comparative analysis of SI joint fusion techniques, culminating in a synthesis of evidence and identification of unmet needs.

## 2. Background & Clinical Context

SI joint disorders are a well-known medical condition with both surgical and nonsurgical treatment options (Cher, 2015). The prevalence of low back pain originating from the SIJ is thought to range anywhere from 2% to 30% (Rahl et al., 2022). Surgical options have involved decortication of the SI joint and permanent fixation using screws and plates during an open surgical procedure (Cher, 2015). More recently, several devices for minimally invasive SI joint fusion have become commercially available (Cher, 2015). The SIJs are mobile in all 3 anatomic planes and have been shown to have intra-articular pain generators along with closely associated extra-articular pain generators (Rahl et al., 2022). The SI joint is stabilized by strong ligaments and muscles, allowing for limited motion (Rahl et al., 2022). Cannulated screws are the gold standard for percutaneous treatment of sacroiliac (SI) pelvis ring injuries (Berk et al., 2023). The choice of whether to use these screws in combination with a washer is still undecided (Berk et al., 2023). When conservative treatment for SIJ pain fails, arthrodesis becomes a viable option to reduce or eliminate pain from this joint (Rahl et al., 2022). The number of SIJ fusions continues to be on an annually accelerating upward trend (Rahl et al., 2022). The complication rate for minimally invasive SIJ arthrodesis has been reported to be between 0% and 18% with revision rates ranging from 0% to 6.3% (Rahl et al., 2022). Complications can arise from improper implant placement, leading to malposition and potential nerve impingement (Rahl et al., 2022).

### 3. Clinical Presentation & Diagnosis

The clinical presentation of SI joint dysfunction often involves low back pain, which may radiate to the lower extremities. Diagnosis typically involves a combination of physical examination, provocative maneuvers, and imaging studies (Rahl et al., 2022). The most common symptom reported by patients was radicular pain (Rahl et al., 2022). Diagnostic criteria include pain provocation tests and imaging to confirm SI joint involvement (Rahl et al., 2022). Core symptoms include low back pain, buttock pain, and pain radiating to the leg. Functional limitations may include difficulty with activities like walking, sitting, and standing (Rahl et al., 2022). Clinical tests and maneuvers are used to assess SI joint pain (Rahl et al., 2022). Imaging modalities include X-rays, CT scans, and MRI to evaluate the joint and rule out other causes of pain (Rahl et al., 2022). Non-surgical management includes physical therapy, medication, and injections (Rahl et al., 2022). Surgical indications are considered when conservative treatments fail, with minimally invasive SI joint fusion being a common approach (Rahl et al., 2022).

## 4. CORE DEVICE ANALYSIS: SI JOINT FUSION

This section will analyze the iFuse Implant System and the biomechanical impact of washers in SI joint fusion, focusing on screw designs and their performance (Berk et al., 2023). The iFuse Implant System is a permanent implant used to perform minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion (Cher, 2015). The biomechanical competence of S1-S2 SI screw fixations, with and without using a washer, across three different screw designs was evaluated (Berk et al., 2023). The iFuse Implant System is intended for sacroiliac fusion for conditions including sacroiliac joint dysfunction (Cher, 2015). The iFuse Implant System includes a delivery system to place a series of triangular titanium implants coated with a porous titanium plasma spray across the SI joint using a lateral, transarticular approach under fluoroscopic guidance (Cher, 2015). The iFuse implant's shape allows for immediate stabilization of the joint and the titanium plasma spray coating allows for biologic fixation in bone (Cher, 2015). The biomechanical principles involve achieving fusion through stabilization and bone ingrowth (Cher, 2015). The survivorship rate with this implant is high and improving (Cher, 2015). The 4-year survival rate free from revision surgery was 96.46% (Cher, 2015). The omission of the washer in fully threaded short screws could lead to a significant diminished biomechanical stability (Berk et al., 2023).

## 5. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

This section compares the biomechanical performance of different screw designs (partially threaded, fully threaded short, and fully threaded long transsacral) with and without washers in SI joint fusion (Berk et al., 2023). Partially threaded short and fully threaded long transsacral screws demonstrated equivalent biomechanical stability under dynamic loading disregarding whether a washer was used or not (Berk et al., 2023). Omission of the washer led to a significantly diminished biomechanical stability under dynamic loading with fully threaded short screws (Berk et al., 2023). The clinical rationale for using washers is to enhance fixation and prevent screw intrusion (Berk et al., 2023). The study by Berk et al. found that the omission of the washer in fully threaded short screws could lead to a significant diminished biomechanical stability (Berk et al., 2023). The study also found that partially threaded short and fully threaded long transsacral screws demonstrated equivalent biomechanical stability under dynamic loading disregarding whether a washer was used or not (Berk et al., 2023). Technical differences include screw thread design and length, which influence biomechanical properties (Berk et al., 2023). The study by Berk et al. found that the number of cycles to failure and the corresponding load at failure (N) were significantly higher for the fully threaded short screws with a washer versus its counterpart without a washer (Berk et al., 2023). The study also found that the omission of the washer led to a significantly diminished biomechanical stability under dynamic loading with fully threaded short screws (Berk et al., 2023). The failure modes for all fixation methods were expressed by a fracture of the ilium between the polymethylmethacrylate ilium fixation and the S2 SI screw (Berk et al., 2023). The study by Berk et al. used three different screw designs: partially threaded short screws, fully threaded short screws, and fully threaded long transsacral screws (Berk et al., 2023). The study found that a washer could be optional when using partially threaded short or fully threaded long transsacral S1-S2 screws for treatment of posterior pelvis ring injuries in young trauma patients (Berk et al., 2023).

## 6. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS & GAPS

This section synthesizes the evidence on the biomechanical efficacy of washers in SI joint fusion, highlighting key findings, limitations, and unmet clinical needs (Berk et al., 2023). From a biomechanical perspective, a washer could be optional when using partially threaded short or fully threaded long transsacral S1-S2 screws for treatment of posterior pelvis ring injuries in young trauma patients (Berk et al., 2023). The omission of the washer in fully threaded short screws could lead to a significant diminished biomechanical stability (Berk et al., 2023). The study by Berk et al. found that the omission of the washer led to a significantly diminished biomechanical stability under dynamic loading with fully threaded short screws (Berk et al., 2023). Partially threaded short and fully threaded long transsacral screws demonstrated equivalent biomechanical stability under dynamic loading disregarding whether a washer was used or not (Berk et al., 2023). The study by Berk et al. used artificial bone models, which may not fully simulate the complexities of human bone (Berk et al., 2023). The study's failure modes, fracturing of the ilium, may not be clinically relevant for young patients (Berk et al., 2023). Missing torque data on the tightening force of the screws with and without washers is another limitation (Berk et al., 2023). Further biomechanical cadaveric studies should be initiated for a reliable interpretation of washerless fixations and their potential for the therapy of the injured posterior pelvis ring (Berk et al., 2023). There is a need for more research to determine the optimal screw design and technique for SI joint fusion (Berk et al., 2023).

## 7. CONCLUSION

The biomechanical study by Berk et al. provides valuable insights into the role of washers in SI joint fusion, suggesting that their use may be optional with certain screw designs (Berk et al., 2023). The findings have implications for surgical technique and implant selection, potentially influencing the stability and long-term outcomes of SI joint fusion procedures (Berk et al., 2023). Future research should focus on cadaveric studies and clinical trials to validate these findings and further optimize SI joint fusion techniques (Berk et al., 2023). The use of washers in SI joint fusion should be carefully considered based on screw design, with the understanding that the omission of washers in fully threaded short screws may compromise biomechanical stability (Berk et al., 2023).
