Surgical options have involved decortication of the SI joint and permanent fixation using screws and plates during an open surgical procedure <citation author='Cher' year='2015'>. More recently, several devices for minimally invasive SI joint fusion have become commercially available.",

Cannulated screws are the gold standard for percutaneous treatment of sacroiliac (SI) pelvis ring injuries <citation author='Berk et al.' year='2023'>. The choice of whether to use these screws in combination with a washer is still undecided <citation author='Berk et al.' year='2023'>.",

The SI joint is stabilized by strong ligaments and muscles, allowing for limited motion.",
