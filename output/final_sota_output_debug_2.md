# 1. Introduction

Sacroiliac joint (SIJ) dysfunction is a recognized source of low back pain, significantly impacting a patient's quality of life (Rahl et al., 2022). When conservative treatments fail, surgical interventions, such as SIJ fusion, become a viable option to reduce or eliminate pain (Rahl et al., 2022). The increasing number of SIJ fusions performed annually highlights the need for a comprehensive review of the current state of the art (Rahl et al., 2022). This review addresses the gaps in knowledge regarding complications, revision rates, and the impact of surgical techniques on return to sport (Rahl et al., 2022).

This review analyzes the current literature on surgical interventions for SIJ dysfunction, focusing on complications, implant survivorship, and biomechanical considerations (Rahl et al., 2022). The review includes studies on SIJ fusion using FDA 510(k) cleared devices and biomechanical studies evaluating different screw designs (Berk et al., 2023, Cher et al., 2015). The SOTA is organized to provide a comprehensive overview of SIJ dysfunction, surgical techniques, and their impact on return to sport (Rahl et al., 2022). The review begins with an introduction to the clinical context, followed by background information on anatomy, pathophysiology, and epidemiology (Rahl et al., 2022). The core of the review focuses on device analysis, comparative analysis, evidence synthesis, and gaps (Berk et al., 2023, Cher et al., 2015). The review concludes with a synthesis of key findings, clinical implications, and future directions (Rahl et al., 2022, Berk et al., 2023, Cher et al., 2015).

# 2. Background & Clinical Context

SIJ dysfunction is a prevalent cause of low back pain, with surgical fusion being a treatment option when conservative methods fail (Rahl et al., 2022). The SIJs are mobile in all 3 anatomic planes (Rahl et al., 2022). The number of SIJ fusions is increasing annually, with minimally invasive, FDA 510(k) cleared implants being the most utilized (Rahl et al., 2022). The prevalence of low back pain originating from the SIJ is thought to range from 2% to 30% (Rahl et al., 2022).

### Anatomy & Physiology

The sacroiliac joints (SIJs) are mobile in all 3 anatomic planes, with intra-articular pain generators along with closely associated extra-articular pain generators (Rahl et al., 2022). The SIJs play a crucial role in load transfer between the spine and the lower extremities (Rahl et al., 2022). The biomechanical function of the SIJ is essential for activities such as walking, running, and other sports (Rahl et al., 2022). The anatomy and biomechanics of the SIJ are relevant to device design, as the implants must provide stability and promote fusion while minimizing the risk of complications (Rahl et al., 2022).

### Pathophysiology

SIJ dysfunction can result from various mechanisms, including trauma, degeneration, and inflammatory conditions (Rahl et al., 2022). These mechanisms can lead to pain and instability (Rahl et al., 2022). Pathology in the SIJ can lead to symptoms such as low back pain, buttock pain, and referred pain to the lower extremities (Rahl et al., 2022). The pain can significantly impact a patient's ability to participate in sports and other activities (Rahl et al., 2022). The pathophysiology of SIJ dysfunction influences the choice of surgical versus non-surgical treatments (Rahl et al., 2022). Surgical fusion aims to eliminate pain by stabilizing the joint (Rahl et al., 2022).

### Epidemiology

The prevalence of low back pain originating from the SIJ is thought to range from 2% to 30% (Rahl et al., 2022). The number of SIJ fusions is on an annually accelerating upward trend (Rahl et al., 2022). Risk factors for SIJ dysfunction include trauma, repetitive stress, and degenerative changes (Rahl et al., 2022). Demographic patterns show that SIJ dysfunction can affect individuals of all ages, but it is more common in certain populations (Rahl et al., 2022). SIJ dysfunction and its treatment place a burden on healthcare systems and can have socio-economic impacts due to lost productivity and healthcare costs (Rahl et al., 2022).

# 3. Clinical Presentation & Diagnosis

This section focuses on the clinical presentation and diagnostic methods for SIJ dysfunction (Rahl et al., 2022). It covers symptoms, functional impact, diagnostic criteria, imaging modalities, and the current treatment landscape (Rahl et al., 2022). Core symptoms include low back pain, buttock pain, and referred pain (Rahl et al., 2022). Diagnostic criteria involve clinical tests and imaging (Rahl et al., 2022). Current treatment options range from non-surgical to surgical interventions (Rahl et al., 2022).

### Symptoms & Functional Impact

Core symptoms of SIJ dysfunction include low back pain, buttock pain, and pain radiating to the lower extremities (Rahl et al., 2022). Radicular pain was the most common symptom reported by patients (Rahl et al., 2022). Functional limitations include difficulty with activities such as walking, sitting, and standing (Rahl et al., 2022). These limitations can significantly impact a patient's ability to participate in sports and other activities (Rahl et al., 2022). SIJ dysfunction can have a significant impact on quality of life, affecting physical function, social activities, and overall well-being (Rahl et al., 2022).

### Diagnostic Criteria & Imaging

Clinical tests and maneuvers, such as the SI joint provocation tests, are used to assess SIJ dysfunction (Rahl et al., 2022). These tests help to identify the source of pain (Rahl et al., 2022). Imaging modalities, including X-rays, CT scans, and MRI, are used to evaluate the SIJ (Rahl et al., 2022). These imaging techniques can help to identify structural abnormalities and confirm the diagnosis (Rahl et al., 2022). Differential diagnosis includes other causes of low back pain, such as lumbar disc herniation and facet joint pain (Rahl et al., 2022). Diagnostic accuracy is crucial for appropriate treatment selection (Rahl et al., 2022).

### Current Treatment Landscape

Non-surgical management includes physical therapy, medication, and injections (Rahl et al., 2022). These treatments aim to reduce pain and improve function (Rahl et al., 2022). Surgical indications for SIJ fusion are typically based on the failure of conservative treatments and the presence of significant pain and functional limitations (Rahl et al., 2022). Decision points include patient selection and the severity of symptoms (Rahl et al., 2022). Overview of surgical approaches includes minimally invasive techniques using FDA 510(k) cleared implants (Rahl et al., 2022). The choice of approach depends on the patient's condition and the surgeon's preference (Rahl et al., 2022).

# 4. CORE DEVICE ANALYSIS: SI JOINT FUSION

This section provides an in-depth analysis of SIJ fusion devices, including their intended purpose, design features, mechanism of action, and evidence summaries (Cher et al., 2015). The focus is on devices used in minimally invasive SIJ fusion (Cher et al., 2015). Minimally invasive SIJ fusion involves the use of implants to stabilize and fuse the SIJ (Cher et al., 2015). The iFuse Implant System is a commonly used device (Cher et al., 2015). Biomechanical studies evaluate the stability of different screw designs (Berk et al., 2023).

### iFuse Implant System Overview

The iFuse Implant System is intended for sacroiliac fusion for conditions including sacroiliac joint dysfunction that is a direct result of sacroiliac joint disruption and degenerative sacroiliitis (Cher et al., 2015). This includes conditions in which symptoms began during pregnancy or in the peripartum period and have persisted postpartum for more than 6 months (Cher et al., 2015). The iFuse Implant System includes a delivery system to place a series of triangular titanium implants coated with a porous titanium plasma spray across the SI joint using a lateral, transarticular approach under fluoroscopic guidance (Cher et al., 2015). The implant's shape allows for immediate stabilization of the joint and the titanium plasma spray coating allows for biologic fixation in bone (Cher et al., 2015). The iFuse Implant System is an FDA 510(k) cleared device used for minimally invasive SIJ fusion (Cher et al., 2015). The device has been used in numerous clinical studies and has a well-established regulatory status (Cher et al., 2015).

### Mechanism of Action

The iFuse Implant System achieves fusion by providing immediate stabilization of the joint and promoting bone growth across the SIJ (Cher et al., 2015). The implants are designed to create a stable environment for fusion (Cher et al., 2015). Biomechanical principles involve the use of triangular implants that are inserted across the SIJ (Cher et al., 2015). The implant's design and placement provide stability and resist movement (Cher et al., 2015). The mechanism of action of the iFuse Implant System has implications for clinical outcomes, including pain relief, improved function, and fusion rates (Cher et al., 2015).

### Evidence Summary for Each Device

The available literature on the iFuse Implant System includes case series, prospective studies, and multi-center trials (Cher et al., 2015). These studies evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the device (Cher et al., 2015). Key outcomes include fusion rates, pain relief, and functional improvement (Cher et al., 2015). The iFuse Implant System has demonstrated positive outcomes in terms of pain reduction and improved function (Cher et al., 2015). Safety and complications include implant malposition, neural impingement, and the need for revision surgery (Cher et al., 2015). The revision rate with this implant is high and improving (Cher et al., 2015). The strengths of the evidence include the use of prospective studies and multi-center trials (Cher et al., 2015). Weaknesses include the lack of long-term follow-up in some studies and the potential for bias in industry-sponsored studies (Cher et al., 2015).

# 5. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

This section provides a comparative analysis of different SIJ fusion techniques and devices (Berk et al., 2023). It focuses on the clinical rationale, outcomes, and technical differences between the approaches (Berk et al., 2023). Different screw designs and techniques are used for SIJ fusion (Berk et al., 2023). Biomechanical studies compare the stability of these techniques (Berk et al., 2023). Clinical outcomes vary depending on the technique used (Berk et al., 2023).

### Comparison of Devices (Rationale, Outcomes, Technical)

The choice of SIJ fusion technique depends on factors such as the patient's condition, the surgeon's preference, and the specific goals of the surgery (Berk et al., 2023). Different screw designs and techniques are used to achieve fusion (Berk et al., 2023). Outcomes such as fusion rates, pain relief, and complication rates vary depending on the technique used (Berk et al., 2023). The use of a washer with fully threaded short screws could lead to a significantly diminished biomechanical stability (Berk et al., 2023). The omission of the washer in fully threaded short screws could lead to a significant diminished biomechanical stability (Berk et al., 2023). Technical differences include the type of implants used, the surgical approach, and the biomechanical principles involved (Berk et al., 2023). The use of partially threaded short or fully threaded long transsacral S1-S2 screws for treatment of posterior pelvis ring injuries in young trauma patients, a washer could be optional (Berk et al., 2023). The surgical method of S1-S2 SI screw fixation of the posterior pelvis ring without the washer has never been evaluated biomechanically (Berk et al., 2023).

# 6. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS & GAPS

This section synthesizes the key findings from the literature and identifies evidence gaps and limitations (Rahl et al., 2022, Berk et al., 2023, Cher et al., 2015). It also discusses unmet clinical needs and areas for future research (Rahl et al., 2022, Berk et al., 2023, Cher et al., 2015). The majority of complications reported to MAUDE for FDA 510(k) cleared SIJ fusion devices are from user error (Rahl et al., 2022). There is a lack of formal tracking of SIJ fusions (Rahl et al., 2022). More studies are needed to evaluate the underlying causes and true complication and revision rates following SIJ fusions (Rahl et al., 2022).

### Summary of Key Findings

Major clinical insights include the effectiveness of SIJ fusion in reducing pain and improving function (Rahl et al., 2022). The majority of complications reported to MAUDE for FDA 510(k) cleared SIJ fusion devices are from user error due to improper placement of implants (Rahl et al., 2022). Patterns in safety and effectiveness show that the revision rate with the iFuse Implant System is high and improving (Cher et al., 2015). The omission of the washer in fully threaded short screws could lead to a significant diminished biomechanical stability (Berk et al., 2023). Design-related implications include the importance of implant design and surgical technique in achieving successful outcomes (Rahl et al., 2022, Berk et al., 2023, Cher et al., 2015). The root cause of the complications reported to MAUDE was user error at 58.2% (Rahl et al., 2022).

### Evidence Gaps & Limitations

Methodological weaknesses in the literature include the lack of standardized outcome measures and the potential for bias in industry-sponsored studies (Rahl et al., 2022, Cher et al., 2015). This study has several limitations (Rahl et al., 2022). This is a retrospective database analysis (Rahl et al., 2022). Missing populations or endpoints include the lack of long-term follow-up data and the absence of information on return to sport (Rahl et al., 2022). The best available data was obtained, extrapolated, and analyzed for overall trends (Rahl et al., 2022). The impact of these gaps on interpretation is that the true complication and revision rates may be underestimated (Rahl et al., 2022). There is currently no standardized tracking system of total annual SIJ fusions performed (Rahl et al., 2022). Therefore, accurate complication and reoperation rates are impossible to calculate (Rahl et al., 2022).

### Unmet Clinical Needs

Lack of long-term data on the durability of SIJ fusions and the impact on patient outcomes (Rahl et al., 2022). The complications reported and examined here are likely underreported, and there is currently no formal tracking system of total SIJ fusions performed to calculate accurate complication and revision rates (Rahl et al., 2022). Gaps in patient selection evidence, including the identification of patients most likely to benefit from surgery (Rahl et al., 2022). The available data currently lacks specific surgeon demographics, so further categorization is not possible (Rahl et al., 2022). Rationale for innovation or new studies, including the need for improved surgical techniques and implant designs to reduce complications and improve outcomes (Rahl et al., 2022). Additional biomechanical cadaveric studies should be initiated for a reliable interpretation of washerless fixations and their potential for the therapy of the injured posterior pelvis ring (Berk et al., 2023).

# 7. CONCLUSION

SIJ fusion is an effective treatment for SIJ dysfunction, but complications and revision rates exist (Rahl et al., 2022). The majority of complications reported to MAUDE for FDA 510(k) cleared SIJ fusion devices are from user error due to improper placement of implants (Rahl et al., 2022). Improved education, training, and oversight are needed to reduce complications and improve patient outcomes (Rahl et al., 2022). From a biomechanical perspective, a washer could be optional when using partially threaded short or fully threaded long transsacral S1-S2 screws for treatment of posterior pelvis ring injuries in young trauma patients (Berk et al., 2023). Future research should focus on long-term outcomes, patient selection criteria, and the impact of surgical techniques on return to sport (Rahl et al., 2022). Additional biomechanical cadaveric studies should be initiated for a reliable interpretation of washerless fixations and their potential for the therapy of the injured posterior pelvis ring (Berk et al., 2023). SIJ fusion offers a valuable treatment option for SIJ dysfunction, but ongoing efforts are needed to optimize surgical techniques and improve patient outcomes (Rahl et al., 2022).
