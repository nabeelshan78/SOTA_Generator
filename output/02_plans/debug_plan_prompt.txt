Abstract
Purpose  To assess clinical and safety outcomes associated with different rod materials and diameters in adult spinal deform-
ity (ASD) surgery.
Methods  A systematic literature review and meta-analysis evaluated ASD surgery using pedicle screw fixation systems 
with rods of different materials and sizes. Postoperative outcomes (i.e., Cobb, sagittal vertical axis, and pelvic tilt angle) 
and complications (i.e., pseudarthrosis and rod breakage) were assessed. Random effects models (REMs) pooled data for 
outcomes reported in ≥ 2 studies.
Results  Among 50 studies evaluating ASD surgery using pedicle screw fixation systems, 17 described rod material/diameter. 
Postoperative outcomes did not statistically differ between cobalt–chromium (CoCr) vs. titanium (Ti) rods (n = 2 studies; 
mean [95% confidence interval (CI)] sagittal vertical axis angle: CoCr 37.00° [18.58°–55.42°] and Ti 32.58° [24.62°–40.54°]; 
mean [95% CI] pelvic tilt angle: CoCr 26.20° [22.87°–29.53°] and Ti 20.15° [18.0°–22.31°]). The pooled proportion (95% 
CI) of pseudarthrosis was 15% (7–22%) for CoCr and 12% (− 8–32%) for stainless steel (SS) (n = 2 studies each; ­Chi2 = 0.07, 
p = 0.79). The pooled proportion (95% CI) of broken rods was 12% (1–22%) for Ti (n = 3 studies) and 10% (2–19) for CoCr 
(n = 1 study). Among 6.0–6.35 mm rods, the pooled (95% CI) postoperative Cobb angle (n = 2) was 12.01° (9.75°–14.28°), 
sagittal vertical axis angle (n = 4) was 35.32° (30.02°–40.62°), and pelvic tilt angle was 21.11° (18.35°–23.86°).
Conclusions  For ASD patients undergoing posterior fixation and fusion, there are no statistically significant differences in 
postoperative outcomes or complications among rods of varying materials and diameters. Benchmark postsurgical outcomes 
and complication rates by rod material and diameter are provided.

Introduction
Adult spinal deformity (ASD) is a heterogeneous spectrum 
of abnormalities of the lumbar spine or the thoracolum-
bar spine that occurs in adult patients [1–3]. Specific ASD 
diagnoses include primary degenerative sagittal imbalance, 
iatrogenic spinal deformity, and adult spinal scoliosis [1, 
2]. Symptoms of ASD include back and leg pain, numb-
ness, tingling, and weakness [1]. These symptoms can 
result in functional limitations including difficulty stand-
ing upright, bending, and lifting, as well as ambulation and 
exercise intolerance [1]. The most common causes of spinal 
deformity in adults are iatrogenic flatback and degenerative 
scoliosis [1]. The global prevalence of adult spinal deform-
ity is estimated to affect between 32–68% of individuals 
aged &gt; 65 years, and the numbers of patients with ASD 
is expected to increase with age progression and a rise in 
life expectancy [4]. ASD may have a profound impact on a 
patient’s quality of life; however, there is significant vari-
ability in patient presentation [5].
The management of ASD usually begins with medical/
interventional treatment with the goals of reducing pain and 
improving function. Operative treatment may be suggested 
for patients with progressive deformity, neural compromise, 
pain, and functional limitations which are not responsive 
to nonoperative conservative treatment [6, 7]. The aim of 
operative management of ASD is to restore spinal balance,

relieve pain, and achieve solid fusion of vertebral segments. 
Depending on clinical presentation, a combination of surgi-
cal options including decompression, correction of deform-
ity using osteotomies, rod manipulation maneuvers, and 
fusion may be carried out to achieve these goals [8]. Surgical 
treatment with pedicle screw fixation systems is a definitive 
management option for patients diagnosed with ASD.
Recent recognition of the importance of restoring sagittal 
balance [9], along with advances in surgical techniques and 
instrumentation have improved postoperative outcomes after 
ASD surgery; however, there are still opportunities for fur-
ther improvement [10]. Although surgical management has 
been found to be beneficial for carefully selected patients, 
there is a risk of complications including dural tears, deep 
and superficial wound infections, implant complications, 
pseudarthrosis, adjacent segment disease, and acute and 
delayed neurological deficits [10, 11].
Multiple factors contribute to the successful correction 
of ASD and to minimizing the complications that may arise 
with surgical treatment [12, 13]. Spinal fixation rods are 
an important component of pedicle screw fixation systems 
and may play a significant role in the overall surgical out-
comes and in the likelihood of complications [12]. Surgeons 
require rod options that resist rod fracture and breakage and 
that deliver the optimal alignment and treatment approach 
to meet the needs of each patient [12–18]. It is important to 
gain a better understanding of the rod-specific factors that 
may contribute to successful surgical and safety outcomes 
in ASD patients. More specifically, a better understanding 
of the clinical and economic value of various types of rods 
available for the surgical management of ASD would help 
healthcare providers and payers prioritize resource alloca-
tion and develop more effective and targeted interventions 
for the surgical treatment of ASD. Hence, the objectives of 
this study were to assess current evidence of the postopera-
tive outcomes and complications associated with differing 
rod materials and dimensions for the operative treatment of 
ASD. An assessment of the current evidence will identify 
gaps that will inform priorities for future research.
Methods
Study design and approach
The systematic literature review and meta-analysis com-
pared different rod characteristics for the surgical treatment 
for ASD. The systematic literature review was conducted 
and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guide-
lines [19]. The systematic review protocol was registered 
in the York PROSPERO database (PROSPERO: A registry 
for systematic review protocols | Augustus C. Long Health 
Sciences Library [columbia.edu]; PROSPERO 2020).
Literature search strategy
The literature search was conducted on November 20, 2020 
by electronic searching of MEDLINE, Embase, KOSMET: 
Cosmetic Science, APA PsycInfo, and BIOSIS Previews. 
The search terms and search strategy utilized were: (spine* 
OR vertebra*) AND (fusion AND stabilization) AND (rods) 
AND (adults). The types of studies included were rand-
omized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized clinical 
trials or studies, cohort studies, case control studies, registry 
studies, economic studies (budget impact and cost-effective 
analyses), and case series. Relevant secondary research with 
the highest levels of evidence, specifically systematic litera-
ture reviews and meta-analyses, was also included. Study 
types that were excluded were those that were technical arti-
cles, animal/cadaver studies, case reports, editorials, com-
mentaries, and letters. Only English language literature was 
considered for review. The search was restricted to articles 
published on or after January 1, 2010.
Types of participants and interventions
Studies reporting adult patients aged &gt; 18 years at the time 
of surgery, who had been diagnosed with any kind of spinal 
deformity (including congenital, degenerative, idiopathic, 
iatrogenic spinal deformity, flat back syndrome, failed 
back syndrome) were considered for the study. Adult spine 
deformity patients with other comorbid conditions were also 
eligible and were considered for the study. Studies report-
ing patients aged ≤ 18 years were excluded. Similarly, stud-
ies with patients without any spinal deformity were also 
excluded from the analysis.
Studies reporting any surgical management for spine 
deformity using any type of rods were included. While the 
majority of studies included only or mostly posterior pedicle 
screw fusion and fixation alone, other approaches included 
anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF), posterior lumbar 
interbody fusion (PLIF), transforaminal lumbar interbody 
fusion (TLIF, open or MIS–TLIF) along with the posterior 
pedicle screw construct. Deformity correction techniques 
included Ponte osteotomy, Smith–Petersen osteotomy 
(SPO), pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO), and vertebral 
column resection (VCR). In addition, studies reporting dif-
ferent types of spine surgeries including primary surgeries, 
secondary surgeries (i.e., patients who already had previous 
spine surgeries prior to the surgery done during the actual 
study), or revision surgeries were also included. Studies 
involving surgical management of spine deformity but not 
incorporating rods or pedicle screws were excluded. Studies 

1267

incorporating other conventional non-pharmacological treat-
ments and experimental treatments were also excluded.
Surgical outcomes
An effort was made to capture and consider major postopera-
tive outcomes and complications in the systematic review 
and meta-analysis. The postoperative outcomes that were 
evaluated included postoperative Cobb angle, sagittal verti-
cal axis angle, and pelvic tilt angle. Postoperative complica-
tions that were evaluated included pseudarthrosis and rod 
breakage. Proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) was not evalu-
ated as there were no studies meeting the inclusion criteria 
and evaluating specific rod materials and/or diameters that 
reported PJK.
Study selection procedure and data extraction
Two reviewers independently applied the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria to screen de-duplicated titles and abstracts 
obtained from the search strategy. Potentially relevant cita-
tions were checked in a full-text screening. Disagreements 
were resolved through discussion and reasons for exclusion 
were recorded. Figure 1 illustrates the study selection pro-
cess as a PRISMA flow diagram.
Pre-specified data that were extracted from the relevant 
studies included the journal citation, study objectives, study 
design and data source, intervention, comparator, study 
population (i.e., baseline demographic and clinical charac-
teristics), sample size, duration of follow-up, primary and 
secondary outcome measures, and author’s conclusions.
Quality assessment of studies
The principles and methodology of Evidence-Based Prac-
tice Guidelines [20] were applied to assess the quality of 
evidence associated with the performance, safety and cost-
effectiveness outcomes from the clinical studies and reports 
included. Studies were appraised for their level of evidence 
based on the study design and the rigor of methodology 
used, as well as the ability to prevent and/or control for 
biases to analyze cause and effect. All included studies were 
critically appraised and ranked using the Evidence level and

Practice [21, 22].
Evidence synthesis and statistical analysis
Both qualitative and quantitative synthesis (using meta-anal-
ysis) were performed. Qualitative synthesis included sum-
marizing individual studies and describing their results with 
respect to the relevant outcomes. For the quantitative synthe-
sis, the data were analyzed using RevMan 5.4 and the meta-
analysis was performed according to Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
guidelines [19]. Pooling and grouping of findings across 
similar studies and study designs was done. Non-statistical 
methodology in synthesizing findings across studies of the 
same level of evidence was applied. Studies that presented 
and discussed relevant mixed cohort data were analyzed and 
summarized separately. Meta-analysis was performed for 
outcomes that were reported in at least two included stud-
ies. For continuous outcome measures (length of stay [LOS] 
and operating room [OR] time), the inverse variance random 
effects model (REM) was used to estimate the pooled mean 
difference (MD). The pooled standardized mean difference 
(SMD) was used for pain scores, since the studies used dif-
ferent pain scales. The mean and standard deviation (SD) 
were extracted from individual studies or were derived from 
medians with interquartile ranges or means with p values. 
For dichotomous outcomes, the Mantel–Haenszel REM was 
used to estimate the pooled risk ratios (RR). For the pooled 
summary statistics for each outcome in the surgical and non-
surgical intervention groups, inverse variance REMs were 
used. All effect sizes were reported with 95% confidence 
intervals (CI). The χ2 test was used to test for statistical het-
erogeneity (α = 0.05) and heterogeneity was quantitatively 
evaluated using I2 statistics. Subgroup analyses evaluating 
the impact of (a) duration of study follow-up; (b) rod mate-
rial; and (c) rod diameter were also conducted. The statisti-
cal significance was set at p value ≤ 0.05.
Results
Study identification and selection
The literature search yielded 1260 citations which were 
screened for inclusion. Full texts of 537 of the studies 
were retrieved for further screening, of which 189 were 
excluded based on the patient population, 59 based on 
the intervention, 50 based on the study design, 21 due to 
lack of relevant outcomes, 11 due to language, and 6 due 
to duplication of study data. A total of 50 studies evaluat-
ing patients aged &gt; 18 years whose surgical management of 
ASD included pedicle screw and rod systems met the study 
inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic litera-
ture review and meta-analysis (Fig. 1).
Descriptive characterization of studies
Of the 50 studies evaluating the surgical management of 
ASD using posterior rods and pedicle screws, 17 studies 
described the rod material type [23–35]. Fourteen of the 17 
studies reported the use of Ti rods either alone [23, 25, 27, 
36, 37] or along with other rod materials.[26, 28–32, 35]. 
Eight studies reported the use of CoCr rods, either alone 
[24, 26, 28, 36] or along with other rod material [29, 31, 
32, 34]. Thirteen studies reported the rod diameter used for 
the surgical management of ASD [23–35]. The rod diam-
eter varied from 5.0 mm [35] to 6.35 mm [28, 32, 33], and 
5.5 mm rods [27, 29]. Table 1 provides a description of the 
50 included studies.
Meta‑analyses
Impact of rod material
Clinical and  functional outcomes  Sagittal vertical axis 
One study utilized CoCr posterior rods for ASD surgery 
and reported the postoperative sagittal vertical axis angle 
of patients (Fig.  2) [24]. The mean postoperative sagittal 
vertical axis angle with CoCr rods was 37.00° (95% CI: 
18.58°–55.42°) [24]. One eligible study with two subgroups 
that utilized Ti rods reported a mean postoperative sagittal 
vertical axis of 32.58° (95% CI: 24.62°–40.54°) [25].
Pelvic tilt angle One study utilized CoCr posterior rods 
for ASD surgery and reported the postoperative pelvic 
tilt angle of patients (Fig. 3) [24]. The mean postopera-
tive pelvic tilt angle with CoCr rods was 26.20° (95% CI 
22.87°–29.53°) [24]. One eligible study with two subgroups 
that utilized Ti rods reported the postoperative pelvic tilt 
angle [25]. The analysis revealed a mean postoperative pel-
vic tilt angle of 20.15° (95% CI: 18.0°–22.31°).
Postoperative complications  Pseudarthrosis Two studies 
used CoCr rods and reported at least one case of pseudar-
throsis in adult patients who underwent spine deformity 
surgery with pedicle screw fixation systems (Fig.  4) [26, 
46]. The overall pooled proportion for pseudarthrosis was 
15% (95% CI 7–22%) in patients receiving CoCr rods. Two 
studies used stainless steel (SS) rods and reported pseudar-
throsis [32, 35]; the overall pooled proportion of pseudar-
throsis was found to be 12% (95% CI − 8–32%). Test for 
subgroup differences showed no significant difference in the 
proportion of pseudarthrosis between the two rod materials 
­(Chi2 = 0.07, p = 0.79).
Rod breakage Three studies that used Ti rods reported 
the presence of broken rods in adult patients who underwent

tems (Fig. 5) [25, 27, 37]. The pooled subgroup propor-
tion of broken rods was 12% (95% CI 1–22%) in patients 
that received Ti rods. Only one included study that used 
CoCr rods reported broken rods in adult patients after spine 
deformity surgery; the proportion of broken rods was 10% 
(95% CI 2–19%) [26]. Testing for subgroup differences was 
not done due to the small number of studies.

and reported data on the postoperative Cobb angle (Fig. 6) 
[24, 26]. The overall pooled postoperative Cobb angle with 
6.0–6.35 mm rods was 12.01° (95% CI 9.75°–14.28°).
Sagittal vertical axis Four studies utilized 6.0–6.35 mm 
posterior rods for ASD surgery and reported data on the 
postoperative sagittal vertical axis angle of patients (Fig. 7) 
[24–26, 28]. The pooled mean postoperative sagittal verti-
cal axis angle with 6.0–6.35 mm rods was 35.32° (95% CI 
30.02°–40.62°).
Pelvic tilt angle Three studies utilized 6.0–6.35 mm 
posterior rods for ASD surgery and reported data on the 
postoperative pelvic tilt angle of patients (Fig. 8) [24, 25, 
28]. The pooled mean postoperative pelvic tilt angle with 
6.0–6.35 mm rods was 21.11° (95% CI 18.35°–23.86°). 
There was a high degree of heterogeneity among included 
studies (I2 = 80%, p = 0.002).
Postoperative complications  No studies reported postop-
erative complication rates by rod diameter.
Discussion
The choice of rod used for the correction of deformity is an 
important consideration in the treatment of ASD. The com-
position and design of the spinal rod must strike a complex 
balance: the rod must be flexible enough for the surgeon to 
bend in the desired curve and have a high enough fatigue 
strength that it does not fracture or break during the thera-
peutic lifetime of the implant. The ability to resist damage 
brought about by contouring will depend on the material 
used and the diameter and shape of the rod. There have been 
significant changes in the types of rods and the materials 
used for rods over the years. Initially, Harrington rods con-
sisted of SS. Present-day rod constructs are more likely to 
consist of either Ti or CoCr. These materials differ in yield 
strength and stiffness, with Ti having a lower yield strength 
and lower stiffness, and CoCr having higher yield strength 
and higher stiffness.
This systematic review and meta-analysis identified 50 
qualifying studies evaluating the surgical management of 
ASD using pedicle screw fixation systems; among which 
17 studies described the rod material and rod diameter used. 
Study findings showed that there was no evidence that surgi-
cal outcomes differed by rod material. Two studies reported

sagittal vertical axis angle and pelvic tilt angle by rod mate-
rial and did not find statistically significant differences 
between CoCr vs. Ti rods (mean postoperative sagittal ver-
tical axis angle: CoCr rods 37.00° [95% CI 18.58°–55.42°] 
and Ti 32.58° [95% CI 24.62°–40.54°]; mean postoperative 
pelvic tilt angle: CoCr rods 26.20° [95% CI: 22.87°–29.53°] 
and Ti 20.15° [95% CI 18.0°–22.31°]). There was an absence 
of evidence evaluating the impact of rod diameter on postop-
erative outcomes and complications. Among 6.0–6.35 mm 
rods, the pooled postoperative Cobb angle was 12.01° (95% 
CI 9.75°–14.28°), the pooled mean postoperative sagittal 
vertical axis angle was 35.32° (95% CI 30.02°–40.62°), and 
the pooled mean postoperative pelvic tilt angle was 21.11° 
(95% CI 18.35°–23.86°).
In regard to complications, the overall pooled propor-
tion of pseudarthrosis with CoCr rods (n = 2 studies) was 
15% (95% CI 7.0–22.0%) and with SS rods (n = 2 studies) 
was 12% [95% CI − 8%–32%) (no significant difference; 
­Chi2 = 0.07, p = 0.79). The pooled proportion of rod break-
age with Ti rods (n = 3 studies) was 12% (95% CI 1.0% 
–22.0%) and CoCr rods (n = 1 study) was 10% (95% CI 
2–19%). No studies reported postoperative complication 
rates by rod diameter.
Pseudarthrosis is one of the most common complica-
tions of ASD surgery, and also one of the most common 
and costly indications for revision surgery [73, 74]. Stud-
ies have also increasingly shown a link between pseudar-
throsis and rod fracture [10, 34, 75–77]. Pseudarthrosis 
has been found to occur in over half of patients with rod 
fracture and three-quarters of patients with clinically sig-
nificant rod fracture [12]. This may be explained by the 
effect of cyclic loading at a non-fused segment, allowing 
micro-movements to increase construct strain and risk of 
instrumentation failure [12]. Patients with radiographic 
evidence of pseudarthrosis after one year postoperatively 
may have increased risk of rod fracture and may require 
more careful observation [12].
Rod fracture is a common, problematic complication of 
ASD surgery, often requiring reoperation [12]. Similar to 
our current analysis, another recent meta-analysis found that 
the overall incidence of rod fracture was 12% [13]. The other 
meta-analysis did not evaluate rod characteristics associated

with rod fracture; however, patient factors found to be asso-
ciated with rod fracture included advanced age, higher 
body mass index, previous spine surgery, pedicle subtrac-
tion osteotomy, a larger preoperative pelvic tilt, and a larger 
preoperative thoracic kyphosis [13]. Efforts to reduce the 
incidence of rod fracture have been made, including the use 
of CoCr rods and multi-rod constructs; [12–18]; however, 
rod fracture continues to be a significant concern with the 
currently available rod treatment options and constructs [13]. 
Hence, there is a need for rods with improved fatigue per-
formance so that breakage and, potentially pseudarthrosis, 
may be minimized.
The systematic review was designed to cover patients 
with ASD as comprehensively as possible given the pub-
lished literature. It identified and summarized 50 studies 
evaluating the surgical management of ASD in which pos-
terior fixation and fusion was part of the treatment plan. 
The study delineated the paucity of data available, and it is 
unfortunate how few of the studies directly compared rod 
materials and/or diameters. PJK was not evaluated in the 
current analyses as there were no studies meeting the inclu-
sion criteria and evaluating specific rod materials and/or 
diameters that reported PJK.
A significant limitation of the meta-analysis component 
of this study is the heterogeneity of the patient populations 
evaluated, the variability in the surgical techniques and tech-
nologies employed, and the definitions of outcomes used in 
the analyses [78]. Reasons for such heterogeneity include 
variability in the definitions of ASD used across the avail-
able studies, resulting in varying pathologies and patient 
populations. The inherent complexity of patient needs and 
comorbidities, along with patient and surgeon treatment 
choices based on these complexities, further contributed 
to the variability. The requirements for customized surgi-
cal plans and the availability of published data with results 
for a specific population with a specific surgical technique 
hinder the accumulation of sufficient numbers of homogene-
ous cases for meta-analyses. Hence, we did not restrict our 
review to particular surgical treatments such as pedicle sub-
traction osteotomies (PSOs) or vertebrectomies or to types 
of technologies such as the use of interbody devices or spe-
cific grafting material. High volume, multi-center studies 
with shared definitions and consistent methods of document-
ing variability will be needed to address the knowledge gaps.
Meta-analysis may offer a way to highlight findings 
within such heterogeneity, including exposing areas for 
future research. It also provides a tool for helping to under-
stand the extent of variability [79–81]. In the field of spinal 
procedures, a growing opinion suggests that inclusion of 
observational studies in meta-analyses might lead to more 
robust conclusions without compromising the quality of the 
results [82, 83]. The current study was conducted in line 
with recommendations available in the literature for the use 
of real-world evidence in meta-analyses [84]. Statistical het-
erogeneity was evaluated using Cochran’s Q test (χ2 test) 
and the ­I2 statistic. Since Q was significant and I2 was &gt; 50%, 
it was appropriate to use the random-effects model (REM) to 
calculate pooled summary estimates. The range of I2 values 
observed in the current study (0% to 98%) is not inconsist-
ent with the range of those observed in other meta-analyses 
of observational data. The heterogeneity present suggests 
that the meta-analysis covered a broad spectrum of patients 
with ASD, and the findings establish a foundation for future 
prospective and retrospective research.
Conclusions
For patients with ASD, there is a paucity of data evaluating 
the impact of rod material and rod diameter on ASD postop-
erative outcomes and complications. However, the current 
study provides benchmark measures of outcomes and com-
plications for rods of varying material and diameter. Studies 
that presented postoperative outcomes and complications of 
ASD surgery by rod material and/or diameter had sizable 
complication rates. Technologies with improved fatigue 
performance (i.e., resisting rod fracture or breakage) could 
improve clinical and functional outcomes and complications.

Purpose: Bone cement-reinforced fenestrated pedicle screws (FPSs) have been widely used in the in-
ternal ﬁxation and repair of the spine with osteoporosis in recent years and show signiﬁcant improve-
ment in ﬁxation strength and stability. However, compared with conventional reinforcement methods,
the advantages of bone cement-reinforced FPSs remain undetermined. This article compares the effects
of fenestrated and conventional pedicle screws (CPSs) combined with bone cement in the treatment of
osteoporosis.
Methods: A clinical control study of FPSs and CPSs combined with bone cement reinforcement in
osteoporotic vertebral internal ﬁxation was performed using the database PubMed, Embase, Cochrane
Library, CNKI, the Wanfang, and the China Biomedical Literature Service System. Two evaluators screened
the relevant literature in strict accordance with the inclusion criteria (diagnosis of participants, type of
clinical study, treatment with FPS and CPS, and outcome indicators) and exclusion criteria (duplicate
literature and missing or incorrect data) and independently conducted data extraction and quality
evaluation. Clinical control studies of direct comparison between FPS and CPS combined with bone
cement reinforcement in patients who were deﬁnitively diagnosed with thoracolumbar fractures or
spinal degenerative diseases were included. Quality evaluation was conducted using the Cochrane risk
bias evaluation tool for randomized controlled studies and using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for retro-
spective case-control studies. RevMan software (version 5.3) was used for the meta-analysis to compare
the clinical efﬁcacy, radiological results, and related complications of the 2 methods.
Results: A total of 13 articles were included, including 7 randomized controlled studies and 6 retro-
spective case-control studies. There were 909 patients in these studies, 451 in the FPS and polymethyl
methacrylate (FPS &amp; PMMA) group and 458 in the CPS and polymethyl methacrylate (CPS &amp; PMMA)
group. The results of the meta-analysis showed that there was no signiﬁcant difference between the 2
groups in operation time, hospital stay, visual analogue score, Japanese orthopaedic association score,
Oswestry disability index score, Cobb angle, vertebral body deformation index and fusion rate (p &gt; 0.05).
The mean difference of intraoperative bleeding volume was 10.45, (95% conﬁdence intervals (CI)
(16.92, 3.98), p ¼ 0.002), the mean difference of loss height of the anterior edge of the vertebral body
after surgery was 0.69 (95% CI (0.93, 0.44), p &lt; 0.001), and the relative risk (RR) of overall
complication rate was 0.43 (95% CI (0.27, 0.68), p &lt; 0.001), including the RR of bone cement leakage rate
was 0.57 (95% CI (0.39, 0.85), p ¼ 0.005). The screw loosening rate (RR ¼ 0.26, 95% CI (0.13, 0.54),
p &lt; 0.001) of the FPS group was signiﬁcantly lower than that of the CPS group.
Conclusion: The existing clinical evidence shows that compared with the CPS combined with bone
cement, the use of FPS repair in the internal ﬁxation of an osteoporotic vertebral body can reduce the
amount of intraoperative bleeding, be more conducive to maintaining the height of the vertebral body,

1. Introduction
Osteoporosis, a prevalent condition among the elderly, is an
escalating global health concern, impacting around 200 million
individuals globally.1,2 Pedicle screw internal ﬁxation is extensively
employed in managing spinal degenerative ailments and thor-
acolumbar fractures. For secure stable and efﬁcacious use of pedicle
screw internal ﬁxation in preventing screw loosening, fracture, or
inadequate bone graft, spinal decompression and internal ﬁxation
fusion of patients with osteoporosis have become a pivotal point of
spinal surgery.
Currently, the methods of improving the screw stability in pa-
tients with osteoporosis mainly include: (1) modiﬁcation of the
screws, such as thicker and longer screws, expandable screws, and
coated screws;3e5 (2) advancement in nailing technology, such as
cortical bone track nailing technology;6 and (3) utilization of bone
cement for reinforcing pedicle screws.7 Studies have indicated that
osteoporosis substantially elevates the risk of internal ﬁxation
failure, and when necessary, the application of bone cement rein-
forcement technology proves to be a viable method. According to
different screw designs, 2 primary methods exist for augmenting
bone cement. One of the methods is the employment of the stan-
dard vertebroplasty to inject bone cement into the screw path and
subsequently implant of a conventional pedicle screw (CPS) before
the solidiﬁcation of the bone cement. Another one is initially to
insert the fenestrated pedicle screw (FPS) and then inject bone
cement from the side-hole of the screw through the screw tail for
reinforcement.8,9 Although both methods achieve the objective of
enhancing screw stability, complications associated with bone
cement should be considered carefully, notably the leakage of bone
cement into the spinal canal leading to compression of the spinal
cord and nerve or into the bloodstream inducing cardiac arrest and
pulmonary embolism.10,11 The ﬁrst method is used frequently by
spine surgeons, and its efﬁcacy is widely recognized.
The FPS was invented by Peter J. Ludwig, a famous German
spinal surgeon, in the 1970s. Through continuous improvement and
achievement of reduced vibration noise, enhanced reliability,
simpliﬁed and efﬁcient installation, and accelerated operation
progress,8 the hollow pedicle screw currently used has better
biomechanical fatigue resistance than the CPS. A large number of
studies have demonstrated that the effect of FPS combined with
bone cement reinforcement is comparable to that of traditional
methods, and the incidence of complications is low. To analyze the
differences in clinical efﬁcacy, radiological results, and complica-
tions between the 2 methods in a more detailed and comprehen-
sive way, a clinical control study of FPS and CPS combined with
bone cement polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) reinforcement is
conducted. Meanwhile, after strict screening, a meta-analysis is
performed to provide a reference basis for the clinical placement
strategy of osteoporotic vertebral bodies.

clinical efﬁcacy, radiological results, and operation-related com-
plications were documented and analyzed. A total of 3815 relevant
documents were retrieved, of which 1574 duplicate documents
were excluded. After reading the title and abstract of the docu-
ments, 2218 papers inconsistent with the subject, including
biomechanical research, cadaveric research, animal research, etc.
were excluded from the research. After carefully reading the full
text of the remaining 23 papers, 13 were excluded according to the
exclusion criteria.12e24
2.4. Document quality evaluation adopt
The Cochrane risk bias evaluation tool provided in the Cochrane
evaluation manual 5.1.0 (https://training.cochrane.org/handbooks)
was used. Randomized controlled studies were evaluated for bias
risk from 7 items: selection bias (random sequence generation and
distribution concealment), implementation bias, measurement
bias, follow-up bias, reporting bias, and other bias. Each item was
divided into 3 levels: low-risk,
high-risk, and unclear. The
Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to evaluate the quality of
the included cohort studies from 3 aspects: selection, compara-
bility, and results. The 7 e 9 points indicated high quality, 4 e 6
points indicated medium quality, and &lt; 3 points indicated low
quality. The evaluation was conducted independently by 2 evalu-
ators, and if there is disagreement, it is assessed by a professional
statistician.
2.5. Outcome indicators
Surgical-related complications, operation time, intraoperative
blood loss, inpatient time, visual analog score, JOA score, ODI score,
Cobb angle of the operation segment, loss height of the anterior
edge of the vertebral body, vertebral body deformation index, and
fusion rate were recorded.
2.6. Statistical analysis
The
Cochrane
Collaboration
network
(https://www.
cochranelibrary.com) RevMan5.3 statistical software was used for
the data analysis. Counting data were represented by the relative risk
(RR) and measurement data were represented by the weighted mean
difference (MD). Both values provided a 95% conﬁdence interval (CI)
and the test level was a ¼ 0.05. The I2 test was used to assess the
heterogeneity of each study, and I2 &lt; 50% was used as the test
standard. When there was homogeneity between the studies
(p  0.05, I2 &lt; 50%), the ﬁxed-effect model was used for meta-
analysis. If there was heterogeneity among the studies (p &lt; 0.05,
I2  50%), after excluding signiﬁcant clinical heterogeneity, the
random-effects model was used for meta-analysis.
3. Results
3.1. Literature search results
Finally, 13 papers12e24 were included as shown in Table 1. A total
of 909 patients were included, of which 451 were treated with
internal ﬁxation of FPS strengthened with bone cement, and 458
with CPS combined with bone cement. Fig. 1 illustrates the
document-retrieval process.
3.2. Document quality evaluation results
Seven randomized controlled studies18e24 used the Cochrane
risk bias assessment tool for quality evaluation, 2 of which had high
risk bias22,24 and 5 had low risk bias.18e21,23 None of the studies
mentioned blinding of the participants and researchers. The
blinding of outcome evaluators had little impact on outcome in-
dicators, as shown in Fig. 2. There were 6 high-quality retrospective
case-control studies12e17 with scores above 7 using the NOS scale,
as shown in Table 2.
3.3. Meta-analysis results
3.3.1. Differences in operation time, intraoperative bleeding, and
inpatient time in each group
Eight studies reported a large heterogeneity of operation time
between the studies (p ¼ 0.05, I2 ¼ 50%).14,15,17e19,21e23 A meta-
analysis was performed using a random effects model. The results
showed that there was no signiﬁcant difference in operation time
between the 2 groups (MD ¼ 4.86, 95% CI (10.96,1.24), p ¼ 0.50).
Subgroup analysis was carried out according to different study
types. The combined results of 5 randomized controlled studies and
3 retrospective case-control studies showed that there was no
signiﬁcant difference in operation time between the 2 groups
(MD ¼ 3.32, 95% CI (8.45, 1.81), p ¼ 0.19) and (MD ¼ 12.93, 95%
CI (40.48, 14.62), p ¼ 0.36), respectively, as shown in Fig. 3A.
Nine studies reported intraoperative bleeding with slight het-
erogeneity between the studies (p ¼ 0.33, I2 ¼ 13%).14,15,17e23 The
results showed a signiﬁcant difference in intraoperative bleeding
between the 2 groups (MD ¼ 10.45, 95% CI (16.92, 3.98),
p ¼ 0.002). Intraoperative bleeding in the FPS &amp; PMMA group was
less than that in the CPS &amp; PMMA group, as shown in Fig. 3B.
Five studies reported the inpatient time with heterogeneity
among the studies (p ¼ 0.08, I2 ¼ 51%).14,15,18,19,23 The results of the
meta-analysis showed that there was no signiﬁcant difference in
the inpatient time between the 2 groups (MD ¼ 0.00, 95% CI (-1.19,
1.19), p ¼ 1.00), as shown in Fig. 3C.
3.3.2. Differences in clinical efﬁcacy of each group
Four studies compared the visual analog scores at the last
follow-up and showed signiﬁcant heterogeneity between the
studies (p &lt; 0.001, I2 ¼ 96%).14,17,22,23 The results of the meta-
analysis using the random effects model showed that there was
no signiﬁcant difference between the 2 groups in the visual analog
score at the last follow-up (MD ¼ 0.22, 95% CI: (0.63, 0.19),
p ¼ 0.29), as shown in Fig. 4A.
Two studies compared the JOA scores at the last follow-up, and
there was no heterogeneity between the studies (p ¼ 0.39,
I2 ¼ 0).14,18 The results of the meta-analysis showed that there was
no signiﬁcant difference between the 2 groups in the JOA score at
the last follow-up (MD ¼ 0.81, 95% CI (0.56, 2.17), p ¼ 0.25), as
shown in Fig. 4B.
There was signiﬁcant heterogeneity between eight studies
compared the ODI scores at the last follow-up (p &lt; 0.001,
I2 ¼ 97%).14e18,21e23 The results of the meta-analysis showed that
there was no signiﬁcant difference in the ODI scores at the last
follow-up between the 2 groups (MD ¼ 4.00, 95% CI (8.14, 0.14),
p ¼ 0.06). Subgroup analysis was conducted according to different
study types and the combined results of 4 randomized controlled
studies showed that there was a signiﬁcant difference in the ODI
scores at the last follow-up between the 2 groups (MD ¼ 7.41, 95%
CI (14.98, 0.16), p ¼ 0.06). The combined results of 4 retrospective
case-control studies showed that there was no signiﬁcant differ-
ence in the ODI scores at the last follow-up between the 2 groups
(MD ¼ 0.20, 95% CI (1.17, 0.78), p ¼ 0.69), as shown in Fig. 4C.
3.3.3. Parameter differences of imaging results in each group
Five studies compared the Cobb angle at the last follow-up
showed signiﬁcant heterogeneity (p &lt; 0.001, I2 ¼ 96%).14,15,21,23,24

in Fig. 5A.
Three studies compared the vertebral body deformation index
after surgery. There was signiﬁcant heterogeneity between the

4. Discussion
4.1. Research signiﬁcance
Pedicle screw internal ﬁxation is a commonly employed tech-
nique for stabilizing the thoracolumbar spine, which is used for
correcting deformities, facilitating bone fusion, and ﬁxing fractured
vertebral bodies. However, recent studies have indicated that
osteoporosis represents a signiﬁcant risk factor for screw loosening
in individuals undergoing posterior spinal fusion and internal ﬁx-
ation procedures.25,26 When the bone mineral density of the
vertebral body decreases by 16.5%, 33.6%, and 51.2%, the maximum
axial extraction force decreases by 27.2%, 45.7%, and 68.5%,
respectively.27 Studies have demonstrated that the average pullout
strength of a screw reinforced with bone cement is approximately
400 N higher than an unreinforced screw. This reinforcement
technique can signiﬁcantly enhance the pullout strength of pedicle
screws in osteoporotic vertebral bodies.28 However, the combina-
tion of CPS and bone cement reinforcement presents certain
drawbacks, such as a relatively complex procedure and a high
incidence of bone cement leakage. A new type of hollow pedicle
screw with side holes for bone cement infusion has recently
emerged and gained attention of researchers both domestically and
internationally due to its advantages of simpliﬁed operation and
improved stability. However, it remains uncertain whether bone
cement-reinforced pedicle screws offer additional beneﬁts in
reducing
postoperative
complications,
such
as
bone
cement
leakage and screw loosening.29,30 This article gathers comparative

studies on FPS and conventional reinforcement methods from both
domestic and international sources, aiming to comprehensively
evaluate the disparities in clinical effectiveness and complications
and furnish evidence-based medical data to inform the internal
ﬁxation strategy for osteoporosis.
4.2. Analysis of studies results
The meta-analysis results demonstrate that there is no notable
disparity in the operation time and inpatient duration between the
FPS &amp; PMMA and CPS &amp; PMMA groups. However, in terms of
intraoperative bleeding, the FPS &amp; PMMA group exhibits lower
bleeding compared to the CPS &amp; PMMA group. This difference may
be due to the direct injection of bone cement after the placement of
pedicle screws in the FPS &amp; PMMA group, thus eliminating the need
to inject bone cement prior to screw placement after preparing the
screw pathway. Therefore, this approach can reduce the amount of
blood leakage in the screw pathway. Relief of postoperative pain,
improvement of function and fusion rate are crucial indicators of
clinical effectiveness. Several studies have indicated that applying
PMMA to reinforce FPS produces clinical effects like those of con-
ventional methods, and the application of PMMA also has the
added beneﬁt of improving the ODI score of patients.21,31 Wang
et al.20 further highlight that PMMA-enhanced FPS can effectively
enhance fusion speed, and their study reveals no signiﬁcant dif-
ference in the visual analog score, JOA score, and ODI score between
the 2 groups post-surgery. Furthermore, the fusion rate shows no
remarkable variance between the 2 groups, suggesting that both
groups can achieve comparable and optimal clinical outcomes.
The Cobb angle of the ﬁxed segment, vertebral body deforma-
tion index, and anterior edge height of the vertebral body are the
crucial indicators of spinal stability. Postoperative follow-up ob-
servations can directly and effectively reﬂect the stability of inter-
nal ﬁxation. From a radiological perspective, the meta-analysis
results reveal no signiﬁcant difference in the Cobb angle between
the 2 groups post-surgery, indirectly indicating similar effects on
improving the Cobb angle of the lesion segment. Similarly, there is
no signiﬁcant difference in the vertebral body deformation index.
However, the loss height of the anterior edge of the vertebral body
in the FPS &amp; PMMA group is lower than that in the CPS &amp; PMMA
group, suggesting that FPS &amp; PMMA has an advantage in main-
taining vertebral body height and preventing further loss of height.

mainly anterior to the screw, and some screws also have holes at
the tip. This arrangement allows the bone cement to be injected
into the vertebral body through evenly distributed holes, effectively
preventing
vertebral
collapse
and
reducing
the
risk
of
re-
fracture.32e34
However, there is a high degree of heterogeneity among the
various observation indicators of clinical efﬁcacy and radiological
results in different studies, which may result in some bias in the
ﬁndings. The reasons for heterogeneity are summarized as follows:
(1) differences in the measurement standards of the same index
across studies; 2) inconsistent baseline data of patients; and 3)
differences in the experience and skill of the surgeons involved. To
address this issue, sensitivity analysis is conducted to exclude
studies that could potentially contribute to heterogeneity. After re-
analysis of the combined data, no signiﬁcant changes in effect sizes
are observed, indicating that the conclusion is relatively reliable.
Due to the unique properties of bone cement, this article focuses
on the safety and potential complications of surgery. The leakage of
bone cement into the spinal canal can lead to compression of the
spinal cord and nerves, while into the bloodstream it can result in
serious complications such as cardiac arrest and pulmonary
embolism, necessitating close attention.35,36 Results of the meta-
analysis indicate that the use of FPS signiﬁcantly reduces the
overall incidence of complications, with the respective complica-
tion rates for the 2 groups being 10.90% and 25.84%, respectively.
The most frequent complications include bone cement leakage and
screw loosening. Speciﬁcally, the incidence of these complications
in the FPS &amp; PMMA group are 7.02% and 1.69%, compared to 12.44%
and 7.18% in the CPS and PMMA groups, respectively. Notably,1 case
in the FPS &amp; PMMA group experiences neurological symptoms due
to bone cement leakage,12 while another case in the CPS &amp; PMMA
group
manifests
neurological
symptoms
arising
from
cage
displacement due to screw loosening.22 However, no serious
complications such as cardiac arrest or pulmonary embolism are
reported.
Despite the emergence of numerous bone cement substitutes in
clinical practice, PMMA is still considered the primary material for
bone cement due to its wide range of application and excellent
overall performance. PMMA is characterized by its biological
inertness, low viscosity, ease of injection, rapid solidiﬁcation, and
high curing strength. However, its exothermic polymerization re-
action presents a potential risk of causing damage to surrounding
tissues or nerves. Speciﬁcally, thermal damage is primarily associ-
ated with the leakage of bone cement. In the absence of bone
cement leakage, the exothermic polymerization reaction does not
directly lead to thermal damage to the surrounding tissues.37 Guo
et al.38 demonstrated that in patients with bone cement leakage
due to PMMA reinforcement screws, there is a high rate of leakage
from the segmental and basal vertebral veins, which usually pre-
sents as asymptomatic leakage. The study reports only 1 case with
nerve injury resulting from bone cement leakage into the spinal
canal. No other literature has reported symptomatic bone cement
leakage, consistent with Guo's ﬁndings. The conventional method
of nail path enhancement involves injecting bone cement through
the nail path. However, the distribution of bone cement cannot be
controlled during the injection process, and the screw is inserted
before the solidiﬁcation of the cement. Consequently, the bone
cement may ﬂow back and leak through the nail path, leading to
complications.39
Some researchers have suggested that the use of FPS can be
effective in reducing the incidence of bone cement leakage by
utilizing the distance between the lateral hole and the posterior
vertebral canal. The FPS technique enables the formation of mul-
tiple interfaces, including "screw &amp; bone,” "screw &amp; bone cement,”
and "bone cement &amp; bone” through the lateral hole, which in turn
enhances the resistance to screw pullout. In contrast, the non-
uniform dispersion of bone cement injected using conventional
methods can result in poor biomechanical stability, which may
contribute to screw loosening, uneven force distribution, and sub-
sequent
neurological
symptoms.
Osteoporotic
vertebrae
may
exhibit a reduction in trabecular number up to 50% compared to
healthy vertebrae, so the ﬁxation strength provided by natural bone
alone might not be sufﬁcient. However, the use of PMMA-enhanced
screws can signiﬁcantly improve the stability.22 The key advantage
of FPS over conventional screws is the enhanced convenience and
safety of the bone-cement perfusion process. FPS can be evenly
dispersed within the vertebral body through the lateral foramina.
Therefore, during cement injection, the bone cement can be evenly
distributed around the FPS, generating multiple adhesive in-
terfaces. Biomechanical studies are conducted to evaluate the
extraction force of screws reinforced with PMMA using Instron
testing equipment post-treatment. The results reveal that the
extraction force of screws reinforced with body shaping surgery
(average 918.5 N, p ¼ 0.001) is signiﬁcantly greater than that of the
control group without PMMA reinforcement (average 51 N). This

maximizes the stability and minimizes the occurrence of compli-
cations.40 Furthermore, the research ﬁndings indicate that the FPS
&amp; PMMA group exhibited a lower incidence of cerebrospinal ﬂuid
leakage (0) and incision infection (2.09%) compared to the CPS &amp;
PMMA group (3.14% and 4.86%, respectively). However, there is no
statistically signiﬁcant difference between the 2 groups.
4.3. Limitations of the study
There are some limitations in the study. A predominant inclu-
sion of Chinese literature may potentially introduce language bias.
Despite the high quality of the included studies, the lack of refer-
ence to blinding in the included randomized controlled trials and
the wide variation in follow-up times may have resulted in de-
ﬁciencies in study design and bias control. Discrepancies in the
operating surgeon's experience, as well as variations in patient age,
sex, pedicle screw type and quantity, bone cement quantity, sur-
gical segment, and assessment criteria for certain indicators across
the studies could have impacted on the results. Discrepancies in
researchers' retrieval capabilities and the utilized databases,
coupled with potential non-publication with negative results, may
lead to publication bias. These factors could have inﬂuenced the
robustness of the conclusions.
In conclusion, both bone cement reinforced FPS and CPS
methods demonstrate comparable and favorable clinical outcomes.
The structural design advantages of FPS enhance the convenience
and safety of the procedure. In comparison to conventional rein-
forcement methods, FPS has been shown to diminish intraoperative
bleeding, aid in preserving vertebral body height, and signiﬁcantly
decrease the occurrence of complications such as bone cement
leakage and screw loosening. Nonetheless, owing to the constraints
of this study, the ﬁndings necessitate cautious interpretation. It is
advisable to conduct clinical studies with larger sample sizes, more
rational designs, and higher quality to validate this conclusion.

Abstract
Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures of the thoracolumbar spine can progress to Kümmell’s disease, an avascular 
vertebral osteonecrosis. Vertebral augmentation (VA)—vertebroplasty and/or kyphoplasty—is the main treatment modal-
ity, but additional short-segment fixation (SSF) has been recommended concomitant to VA. The aim is to compare clinical 
and radiological outcomes of VA + SSF versus VA alone. Systematic review, including comparative articles in Kümmell’s 
disease, was performed. This study assessed the following outcome measurements: visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry 
Disability Index (ODI), anterior vertebral height (AVH), local kyphotic angle (LKA), operative time, blood loss, length of 
stay, and cement leakage. Six retrospective studies were included, with 126 patients in the VA + SSF group and 152 in VA 
alone. Pooled analysis showed the following: VAS, non-significant difference favoring VA + SSF: MD –0.61, 95% CI (–1.44, 
0.23), I2 91%, p = 0.15; ODI, non-significant difference favoring VA + SSF: MD –9.85, 95% CI (–19.63, –0.07), I2 96%, 
p = 0.05; AVH, VA + SSF had a non-significant difference over VA alone: MD –3.21 mm, 95% CI (–7.55, 1.14), I2 92%, 
p = 0.15; LKA, non-significant difference favoring VA + SSF: MD –0.85°, 95% CI (–5.10, 3.40), I2 95%, p = 0.70. There 
were higher operative time, blood loss, and hospital length of stay for VA + SSF (p &lt; 0.05), but with lower cement leakage 
(p &lt; 0.05). VA + SFF and VA alone are effective treatment modalities in Kümmell’s disease. VA + SSF may provide superior 
long-term results in clinical and radiological outcomes but required a longer length of stay.

Introduction
Kümmell’s disease is defined as the presence of avascular 
osteonecrosis of the vertebral body, creating a pseudoarthro-
sis. It is well recognized as a complication of osteoporotic 
vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) with consequent 
development of spinal instability, pain, kyphosis, disabil-
ity, and eventually neurological compromise [14], generally 
after a minor spinal trauma [12].
Treatment strategies for Kümmell’s disease may be non-
operative, with pain medication and bracing [7]. However, it 
may need to be surgically managed when pain is refractory, 
there is deformity progress, or neurological deficit appears. 
Vertebral augmentation (VA), with percutaneous kyphop-
lasty (PKP) or percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP), has suc-
cessfully restored vertebral height and decreased pain in 
some clinical series [7, 10]. However, despite the low associ-
ated morbidity of these procedures, late-onset complications

may occur, such as mechanical failure, progressive deform-
ity, and pain [8, 22].
To improve the results of VA, some surgeons proposed 
adding short-segment fixation (SSF)—one level above and 
one level below—to improve construction strength [17]. 
Both surgical treatments have been considered valid options 
for this disease, without clear superiority of one over the 
other in literature [23]. Therefore, the aim of this study 
is to investigate the clinical and radiological outcomes of 
thoracolumbar Kümmell’s disease treated with VA versus 
VA + SSF.
Materials and methods
We performed a systematic review of the literature using 
PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases during Sep-
tember 2020, to identify studies reporting the outcome of 
thoracolumbar Kümmell’s disease treated with VA + SSF or 
VA alone. The systematic review was reported in accordance 
with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [15].
The following PICO acronym was used:
P (Population): adult patients with thoracolumbar Küm-
mell’s disease.
I (Intervention): VA + SSF.
C (Comparison): VA alone.
O (Outcome): visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Dis-
ability Index (ODI), anterior vertebral height (AVH), local 
kyphotic angle (LKA), length of surgery, blood loss, length 
of stay, and cement leakage.
Search strategy and inclusion and exclusion criteria
One author (J.P.C.) performed the database search and 
initially screened articles published from January 2010 to 
September 2020. The screening process of all articles was 
performed using titles and abstracts; the selected articles 
were analyzed for eligibility in full text and assessed by 2 
other independent reviewers (A.G. and G.C.W.). A mismatch 
of one article was resolved by a third reviewer (A.F.J.), and 
that article was subsequently excluded. None of the authors 
had any conflict of interests related to this systematic review.

[All Fields] AND (augmentation OR vertebroplasty OR 
Kyphoplasty) [All Fields]). Records were filtered from 2010 
to date, only in English literature, excluding studies related 
to animals and cadavers.
The inclusion criteria used were comparative case series 
between VA + SSF and VA alone, using pedicle screw instru-
mentation, either open or percutaneous, with or without 
inclusion of the fractured vertebra; patients with single-level 
osteoporotic fracture of the thoracolumbar spine in a non-
acute scenario; studies analyzing patients with the diagnosis 
of Kümmell’s disease or delayed treatment of vertebral com-
pression fractures after failure of medical treatment, pseu-
doarthrosis/nonunion, or presence of intravertebral vacuum 
cleft; and studies with a minimum follow-up of 6 months.
The exclusion criteria were the patients with spinal cord 
compression, those with neurological deficits, and studies 
not reporting results of both surgical techniques separately.
Evidence quality assessment and risk of bias
The risk of bias of all included studies was performed using 
the MINORS assessment tool [19] for non-randomized 
studies evaluated by two independent reviewers. Using this 
instrument, the quality for comparative studies according 
to the scores is as follows: 0–6, very low quality; 7–12, low 
quality; 13–18, moderate quality; and 19–24, high quality 
[16].
Data synthesis and statistical analysis
Data analysis and synthesis were performed using Review 
Manager (RevMan) (computer program) version 5.4.1, The 
Cochrane Collaboration, 2020. For continuous variables, 
the mean difference with a 95% CI was calculated, and for 
dichotomous outcomes, the odds ratio with a 95% CI by 
the Mantel–Haenszel method. For non-randomized studies, 
the outcomes VAS, ODI, AVH, and LKA were compared 
between experimental and control groups, using the change-
from-baseline method, calculating mean difference change 
from preoperative to the final follow-up. Statistical hetero-
geneity among studies was evaluated using I2 test; the fixed-
effect model was used if I2 &lt; 50%, while the random-effect 
model was employed when I2 &gt; 50%. A p value &lt; 0.05 was 
considered significant.
Results
A total of 235 articles were found in the initial search of 
all three databases used. After 31 duplicated articles were 
removed, 204 articles were analyzed and 186 of them were 
excluded. A total of 18 full-text articles were analyzed by 
reviewers, with six studies fully included [1, 5, 6, 9, 10, 
23]. The search mechanism used in the systematic review 
is shown in Fig. 1.
The six articles included in this systematic review are 
summarized in Table 1. All articles included are non-rand-
omized retrospective studies and were consequently assessed 
for the level of perceived risk of bias using the MINORS 
assessment tool [19]; the result was five studies [5, 6, 9, 
10, 23] with moderate quality and one study [1] with high 
quality.
Patient demographics
Patient characteristics related to age and gender are 
provided in all the studies included [1, 5, 6, 9, 10, 23], 
and bone mineral density (BMD) was analyzed in four 
of the six studies [1, 6, 9, 23]; all cases have a density 
range of osteoporosis, without significant differences 
between both groups. In the Chen et al. [1] study, BMD 
was − 3.45 in the VA group and − 2.97 in the VA + SSF 
group (p = NR). Regarding the Kim et al. [9] study, BMD

was − 3.61 ± 0.57 in the VA group, while − 3.55 ± 0.59 
in the VA + SSF group (p = NR). Huang et  al. [6] 
reported − 3.36 ± 0.4 in the VA group and − 3.42 ± 0.4 in 
the VA + SSF group (p = 0.627) for BMD. Finally, Wang 
et al. [23] reported BMD of − 3.4 ± 0.6 in the VA group 
and − 3.5 ± 0.8 in the VA + SSF group (p = 0.538). There-
fore, comparing these reported demographic characteris-
tics regarding BMD, the groups are comparable and it was 
not a significant factor on the decision-making of type of 
treatment. Table 2 summarizes the demographic charac-
teristics of patients from both groups, and a summary of 
the main specific outcomes extracted from the six articles 
included in this systematic review is shown in Table 3.
Notably, only two studies [1, 23] reported results with 
a clinical stage classification system of Kümmell’s dis-
ease with a similar number of treated patients according 
to the stages assessed with the Steel and Li classifica-
tions [1], while the study of Wang et al. [23] preferably 
according to the pattern of the intravertebral vacuum cleft 
rather than the stage of the disease and not affecting the 
decision on treatment modality between these two com-
parable groups.
Clinical outcomes
Visual analog scale
VAS was analyzed in all six studies [1, 5, 6, 9, 10, 23] 
included in this systematic review. Overall, all authors 
reported significant improvement between preoperative and 
postoperative VAS at the final follow-up; these results were 
observed in both treatment modalities without significant 
differences between them, except in the study of Kim et al. 
[9], with significant difference favoring VA + SSF (p &lt; 0.05) 
(Table 4). In the pooled analysis, there was a non-significant 
difference favoring VA + SSF over VA alone: MD − 0.61, 
95% CI (− 1.44, 0.23), I2 91%, p = 0.15 (Fig. 2a).
Oswestry Disability Index
ODI was measured in four studies [6, 9, 10, 23]. In gen-
eral, all authors reported significant improvement between 
preoperative and postoperative ODI score, without signifi-
cant differences between VA and VA + SSF, except for Kim 
et al. [9]; they reported superiority of VA + SSF over VA 
(p &lt; 0.05) (Table 4). The pooled analysis showed a non-sig-
nificant difference between both groups, slightly favoring

Radiological outcomes
Anterior vertebral height
AVH was analyzed in three studies [1, 5, 23]; all of these 
showed a slightly better restoration of the VA + SSF group, 
without significant differences (Table 5). In pooled analysis, 
VA + SSF had a non-significant difference over VA alone: 
MD − 3.21 mm, 95% CI (− 7.55, 1.14), I2 92%, p = 0.15 
(Fig. 3a).
Local kyphotic angle
LKA was measured in all studies [1, 5, 6, 9, 10, 23]. From 
them, three studies [8, 13, 14] reported better kyphotic angle 
correction with VA + SSF, two studies [6, 10] reported 
similar correction between both surgical treatments, and 
one study [5] showed better LKA restoration with VA 
(Table 5). There was a non-significant difference between

Other outcomes
Operative time, blood loss, and hospital length of stay
Four studies compared blood loss and operative time [1, 6, 
9, 10]. Significantly higher blood loss and operative time 
were reported in all studies for the group VA + SSF. Hospi-
tal length of stay was mentioned in two studies [1, 6]; both 
authors observed significantly higher hospital stay in the 
VA + SSF group.
Chen et al. [1] reported minimal blood loss, mean oper-
ative time of 76 min (60–95), and mean hospital stay of 
4.3 days in the VA group, while VA + SSF revealed blood 
loss of 245 mL, mean operative time of 128 min (95–165), 
and hospital stay of 7.2 days (p = NR). Kim et al. [9] reported 
VA + SSF estimated blood loss of 91.1 ± 15.4 mL and oper-
ative time 64.7 ± 15.4 min; both these parameters are not 
mentioned in the VA group. Li et al. [10] reported blood 
loss of 5.3 ± 3.1 mL and operative time of 43.2 ± 21.8 min 
in the VA group, compared with 215.0 ± 170.2 mL of blood

loss and 230.6 ± 87.1 min of operative time in the VA + SSF 
group (p = NR). Finally, Huang et al. [6] reported the fol-
lowing outcomes for VA and VA + SSF, respectively: blood 
loss (9.9 ± 2.7 mL/214.3 ± 17.5 mL) (p &lt; 0.05), operative 
time (43.1 ± 7.1 min/115.9 ± 10 min) (p &lt; 0.05), and hospi-
tal length of stay (3.4 ± 1.2 days/7.6 ± 1.3 days) (p &lt; 0.05). 
The results demonstrated lower values for the VA group in 
all three factors. In pooled analysis, the three outcomes—
operative time, blood loss, and length of stay—showed a 
significant difference favoring VA alone over VA + SSF. 
Operative time: MD 128.46 min, 95% CI (16.20, 240.72), 
I2 97%, p = 0.02 (Fig. 4a); blood loss: MD 204.44 mL, 
95% CI (197.92, 210.97), I2 0%, p &lt; 0.00001 (Fig. 4b); and 
length of stay: MD 3.56 days, 95% CI (2.28, 4.83), I2 87%, 
p &lt; 0.00001 (Fig. 4c).
Cement leakage
Cement leakage was analyzed in four studies [1, 6, 10, 23]. 
Chen et al. [1] reported cement leakage in 11 cases (4 intra-
discal, 3 paravertebral, and 4 intracanal), without neurologi-
cal compromise, in the VA group, whereas in the VA + SSF 
group, five cases of leakage were observed; one of them 
underwent prophylactic decompression without neurologi-
cal compromise. Li et al. [10] observed two cases of cement 
leakage in the VA group (8%), and one case of cement leak-
age (4.2%) in the VA + SSF group. Huang et al. [6] showed 
three asymptomatic cement leakages in the VA group and 
three asymptomatic cement leakages in the VA + SSF group. 
Finally, Wang et al. [23] reported four cases of cement leak-
ages in the VA group. The pooled analysis of cement leak-
age showed a non-significant difference between the groups, 
slightly favoring VA + SSF over VA alone: OR 0.47, 95% CI 
(0.20, 1.07), I2 14%, p = 0.07 (Fig. 5).
Any complication in the VA + SSF group occurred in 24 
patients (19.0%), while in 23 patients (15.1%) in the VA 
group. The complications reported other than cement leak-
age in the six studies included are provided in Table 6.
Discussion
Surgical treatment of Kümmell’s disease is indicated after 
failure of non-operative management, and the decision-mak-
ing regarding the best surgical strategy is still under debate. 
In our systematic review, we found six [1, 5, 6, 9, 10, 23] 
relevant descriptive articles comparing VA + SSF versus 
VA alone for the surgical treatment of Kümmell’s disease. 
Overall, all articles showed significant clinical improvement 
with both treatment modalities, with potentially better clini-
cal and radiological results in the SSF group at the cost of a 
major operative time, major blood loss, and longer hospital 
stay [6, 9, 10, 23].

When considering radiological parameters, VA + SSF 
has shown better LKA correction and AVH restoration as 
compared to VA alone [1, 5, 9, 23]. The use of short-seg-
ment pedicle screws may allow further correction with rod 
maneuvers, which may explain the improvement in LKA. 
The rational to add SSF in VA is to avoid further collapse, 
delayed cement displacement, and refracture, which has 
been reported in some studies when patients with Kümmell’s 
disease were treated with VA alone [11, 20, 25]. The unique 
pattern of cement filling in an empty space instead of cement 
diffusion with trabecular bone observed in acute osteoporo-
tic fractures has been mentioned as a possible cause of poor 
stability in Kümmell’s disease patients [22].
PVP and PKP alone in the surgical treatment of OVCF 
with intravertebral cleft have been compared, demonstrat-
ing similar results in VAS, ODI, LKA, and AVH. However, 
kyphoplasty was associated with lower complication rates, 
especially cement leakage—potentially explained by the 
fact that in kyphoplasty, the cement is injected with lower 
pression [24]. This is of paramount importance when VA 
alone has been chosen. Of note, both minimally invasive 
techniques can be associated with delayed onset cement 
dislodgement in the context of vacuum cleft, leading to a 
circumferential instrumentation as a revision surgery [3]. 
SSF treatment possibly reduces the rate of failure and the 
occurrence of this undesired complication.
Potential advantages of VA + SSF are that it can effec-
tively shorten the entire construct [18], and biomechanically, 
it possibly reduces the load of dorsal implants and possibly 
the risk of implant failure [4]. VA alone, using PKP, can 
develop a new collapse of the cemented vertebrae during 
mid-term follow-up, being associated with the presence of 
an intravertebral cleft, a lack of contact between injected 
cement and endplates, and increased postoperative vertebral 
height [21]. However, a recent clinical analysis comparing 
PKP versus PVP + SSF found that these two surgical meth-
ods had a similar effect on improving the studied outcomes 
(VAS, ODI, LKA), with similar cement leakage [13].

The surgical treatment at the time of diagnosis requires 
to be more aggressively performed than VA alone, due to 
the high rate of related complications during follow-up [11, 
25]. Comparing the same techniques in an acute scenario 
of OVCF, PVP alone is significantly associated to more 
fracture of the treated vertebrae and adjacent vertebras 
when compared to hybrid stabilization [2]. Even though the 
VA + SSF group had significant differences in terms of blood 
loss, operative time, and hospital length of stay, it was not 
associated with increased rates of cement leakage as was the 
case with the VA group.
This systematic review has some limitations that need to 
be addressed; on the one hand, our study included only six 
observational retrospective articles with a relatively small 
number of cases, with each of them having moderate qual-
ity of evidence. This could affect the strength of our results 
and, therefore, the quality of the systematic review. On the 
other hand, Kümmell’s disease is a relatively infrequent 
pathology, making it difficult to carry out larger prospective 
studies. Another limitation is that two studies did not report 
preoperative BMD [5, 6] that could influence the results 
due to the negative effect of osteoporosis in surgical treat-
ment of spinal conditions, as well as only two studies [1, 
23] used a clinical stage classification of the disease prob-
ably impacting the choice of treatment modality. Another 
limitation is related to the short time of follow-up for this 
pathology, requiring longer time of observation for detecting 
a wider spectrum of complications, and for assessing more 
accurately the superiority of one technique over the other. 
Finally, there are different procedures considered in vertebral 
augmentation, making the analysis more clinically heteroge-
neous as well as some outcomes in the pooled analysis with 
considerable statistical heterogeneity.
Nevertheless, this systematic review has also some 
strengths: first, the assessment of outcomes in a long fol-
low-up rather than a comparison between preoperative and 
postoperative outcomes; secondly, subsequent to the study 
design of the studies included—non-randomized—the dif-
ferent preoperative clinical and radiological outcomes were 
analyzed by arm, using the change-from-baseline, com-
paring the amount of improvement between experimental 
and control groups. Finally, it provides useful insights for 
a rare pathology that would be advisable when surgeons 
choose VA + SSF versus VA alone, using the best evidence 
available.
Conclusions
VA in combination with SSF or alone can effectively treat 
Kümmell’s disease of the thoracolumbar spine in neurologi-
cal intact patients, improving outcomes of VAS, ODI, AVH, 
and LKA significantly. However, VA + SSF is associated 
with a trend to have better clinical and radiological outcomes 
as well as lower rates of cement leakage, but with higher 
operative time, blood loss, and hospital length of stay than 
VA alone. Further studies are needed to increase the quantity 
and quality of evidence regarding this controversial topic 
and validate the best surgical treatment for this challenging 
disease.
